night of camping, they discover footprints all around them in the dirt. Their backpacks have been looked through, but nothing has been stolen. This happens a few more nights in a row.","2":"Someone notices eyes glittering in the dark at them. Anyone with darkvision can make out an unidentifiable shape. When light is shone towards them there is nothing there.","3":"You find a corpse with it’s eyes and mouth filled with dirt, still grasping the axe that’s embedded in the nearest tree.","4":"You find a massive circle of felled trees, in the center of which is a malnourished and wild-eyed greataxe wielding orc, yelling about fending off an endless hoard of regrowing enemies.","5":"A deep fog rolls in faster and thicker than one would think is natural. All rolls related to navigation or investigation based on the terrain have disadvantage.","6":"The party is set upon by a group of bandits, ferociously attacking them with abandon. Suspiciously, they do not yell or even speak. DC 10 to notice their mouths have been sewn shut and their eyes look wild with panic, as if their actions are not their own.","7":"A lone child that refuses to talk but will hold one of the adventures hands, and theirs alone (normally while sucking her thumb). If the child feels threatened, she will run away from the party and they won’t be able to find her again. There are no tracks. (Optional: If they look after her for a night, she will leave them a gift.)","8":"A dog with a fancy collar appears to lead the party to an area of disturbed dirt and begins to dig it up. Upon closer inspection the party finds the body of a small girl holding a leash that looks quiet similar to the dogs collar. When they turn to examine the dog, he is nowhere to be found.","9":"Cats appear to be watching the party from the trees. Dozens upon dozens of them. Whenever a member of the party approaches them they run away and can’t be found (may serve as lookouts for a darker force).","10":"While camped for the night, the party’s extinguished campfire relights to a full blaze. The second the party member on watch looks at the fire, it extinguishes completely. The only sign that the mysterious fire ever existed is a faint smell of burning twigs.","11":"Deep in the forest, approaching dusk, the party finds a logging camp. Several small cabins and a mill. Smoke curls lazily up from one or two of the chimneys. There is nobody in the camp. There are plates of food on tables, still warm. Clothes on a washing line are still damp. Only the doors into the mill are locked. As night falls, a fierce storm begins to build, and from the mill the saws can be heard rasping back and forth, though they don’t sound quite right…","12":"The party finds a scraggly, disheveled child apparently lost in the forest. It asks the party for help, should the party agree, they come under the effects of a curse until they defeat the child (Actually a restless Evil) who flees, attempting to lead them into a hazard deeper in the forest.","13":"Small dolls sit in a tree the players pass by. They are wearing crude clothes, and don sticks of specific lengths. Poor perception rolls feel anonymous sets of eyes gazing at you, while good perception rolls can discover them. These dolls, if ignored, will appear again in a different tree a few feet up, requiring lower rolls as they subtly make themselves more obvious. Upon the first investigation, you find that the dolls are poorly stitched together, with leaves still poking out of the burlap fabric, and expressionless faces with small stones as eyes. However, with each successive perception roll as the party walks away, the dolls become slightly more realistic. On additional rolls their rock-eyes appear to follow you (Mona Lisa style), their skin becomes taut and leathery, and their clothes become more realistic. Repeat as necessary, with the players unable to leave a small section of the forest (due to magical barriers, or because walking straight forward keeps leading them back to the same spots.) Eventually, all of the dolls should clearly resemble everyone in the party. It is important that the dolls never appear to move on their own, and in every way act as though an inanimate object would. They can be destroyed, ripped, held, carried, etc. There should also be at least 4 separate perception checks on the dolls IMO. It really draws the frustration out, and that is an expression of fear. The final perception check on the dolls will have the dolls be very hard to find, except by one person, who you can choose beforehand. No matter how well other party members roll, the person you choose will feel a tingling on the back of their neck, and turn around to find the dolls in a high branch. They are nearly perfect mimics of the party, and are standing around the doll that looks like the person who discovered them, whose doll has a thick piece of string around their neck. The person feels paralyzed as the can only just watch due to fear, as time slows around them. The doll-party gazes directly into the player characters real eyes, and gently… pushes. For extra effect, have a pencil ready to snap upon this moment. Sometimes the cheesy sound effect speaks volumes more than words. The party will usually react at this point, let them destroy the dolls. It’s cathartic. If you want to continue the fear though, every one in a while later on, let them see a flicker of movement out of the corner of their eyes. Bonus points if you pick a grunge or mistake to build this off of. Like if a cleric forgets to heal a fighter and the fighter calls, have one of them be the one that pushes the other off, as though the cleric purposely didn’t heal, or the fighter was trying to get revenge. If the party has a rogue, have their doll slip a stick in the back of the hanged on. There’s a ton of customization you can do, and if done well, you can seed a lot of discord between two player characters and build their relationship to be really dynamic. Happy Creepy Crawlies.","14":"After spending more and more time in the forest, the players start to notice the trees have grown faces. It’s unknown if this is just them going crazy, or if it’s real.","15":"As the party sets down for camp they hear a muttering in the shrubs and then creeping out from it they behold a Gibbering Mouther, each eye and mouth seemingly drawn from a different creature, without repetition. Just before their skin and brains begin to itch, each party member realizes they do not recognize any of their kind yet among its monstrous morphology…","16":"As the night lengthens, from the shadows surrounding the campfire, come the light chiming sounds of children’s laughter. The laughter gets louder as the flames fall to coals.","17":"The wood you gathered for the night is not enough to keep the flames high all night and the sounds are deeper from the dark woods.","18":"A sweet glade, dappled with sunlight and shadows provide a relief from the previous heat and humidity. A gentle brook flows along one edge and gurgled merrily. Several fruit trees sit in the center and lay heavily with ripe fruits. Flowers fragrant the air and a gentle breeze cool the glen, sweetening the air and cooling the weary traveler. An old body hangs from a limb of the tree, but upon inspection it appears obvious they could have stood and not strangled.","19":"You come across an alter, freshly used and dripping with blood. Meat has been portioned and set out for something.","20":"An open clearing shows the remains of several bodies arranged in a glyph like patter. Due to dismemberment and missing pieces you are not sure how many bodies were used. As you review the scene, the trail behind you vanishes and leaves naught but deep and ancient thorn bushes, redolent with the faint reek of decaying flesh.","21":"A medium sized hut made of gingerbread and various pieces of candy. A kindly old woman asks you in for dinner.","22":"A pile of shit with human clothes, hair and bones in.","23":"The party find a clearing with an odd nature alter in the center. While they are distracted, the trees around them move closer. If they are distracted for long enough, the trees form a complete wall. The trees do not attack; they only defend themselves if attacked.","24":"There is a tree with deep scratches in it, as if it has been attacked by a dagger. Upon inspection, the player discovers old, dried blood embedded in the bark and writing in a deep red color that says ‘Find me, help me’ (illusory script). As the party continues they see more trees of a similar nature, and eventually find a crazed gnome who is determined to eat party members in order to restore his youth.","25":"The path opens into a clearing. Near the center is a unicorn lying down on its side. It looks serene and peaceful. The clearing is bright and quiet. Almost silent but for distant birdsong. If the party approach they realize it is dying. Its throat is torn open by some powerful beast and the wound looks infected or poisoned. The edges of the clearing are creeping in, going brown or fungus laden and choked with weeds and branches, which seem to close in whenever no one is looking in that direction. The unicorn is probably (?) past any help the party can give but may last an hour. Left to its own devices, the clearing will close in maybe 20 minutes.","26":"The trees appear to be leaning closer together and are a different shade of green to normal trees. As a breeze blows they seem to be whispering to each other wisha…wisha…wisha","27":"The undergrowth is thick confining you to a narrow path. It switched sharply left then right…. to a dead end. Turning back it is a dead end that way. The only way forward is to hack through the lower branches and scrub. As the players do, the cut stems ooze blood. If burned instead the wet plants hiss and whistle as they burn sounding like tortured screams.","28":"You begin to notice that everything looks familiar. Slowly it dawns on you that the trees are all identical, right down to that twig that snapped off when it caught on you backpack.","29":"A family of forest giants has caught the scent of the party while hunting. They’re catching up.","30":"Disembodied screams echo around you. Ghosts of the past? Or maybe it’s Jim the halfling rogue, trying to scare off tourists so he can start a coalmine?","31":"In the distance you see a light. When you get closer you see a lamp hanging from a tree swinging in the wind. It is full of oil but there are no signs of whoever put the lamp there.","32":"You find humanoid skeletons tied together to form the rough shape of a horse. If you use speak with dead on it, it only screams.","33":"You suddenly realize that all the noise in the forest is gone. As if silence had been cast but you can still talk and make noise as normal. Suddenly the forest is filled with howls, screeches, and buzzing so loud it deafens the party. When the party can hear again the forest is back to normal.","34":"You come across a cottage in the woods belonging to a friendly woodsman and his wife. They provide food and shelter for the night. When the party awakes they are in the burned down ruins of a cottage with the skeletal remains of the farmer and his wife reaching desperately for the party.","35":"A hooded figure sits on a stump. He does not respond to anything. If you attack or touch the figure they collapse into a swarm of spiders.","36":"A parrot is found on a branch repeating the words ‘Gods what is that?!’","37":"The party finds a wanted poster tacked to a tree with a group shot of the party with a red X marked through two of the party members faces. The party does not remember posing for this picture nor know why they would be wanted.","38":"You come upon a dry riverbed. From the trees lining the banks dangle a hundred mutilated corpses.","39":"Two children play fight with sticks, laughing and taunting each other. When they notice the party watching, they’ll happily put on a show. That’s when the other children emerge from the trees, only they aren’t playing and they’ve got more than just sticks and stones.","40":"A strangely inviting cave comes in to view. Surely it’s some kind of den and we shouldn’t go in but I just… cant…. help it.","41":"From deep within the forest loud clicking and chattering noises of various pitches and tempo can be heard. Upon inspection a small city raiding party dressed in armor have been brutally mutilated with heads twisted round and limbs ripped off. The same clicking noise starts again and gets closer and louder. When it seems like the creature is on top of them it suddenly stops and does not reappear.","42":"It has been at least 24 hours since sunset and it has yet to come back up. What’s worse is that all the forest chatter from insects and wildlife has trickled nearly to a standstill save for one slow but consistent crunching that has been following at a distance for hours now. Are the stars even moving anymore?","43":"Early in the day the party passes underneath a suit of armor suspended in the trees, branches occupying the inside of the suit as if they had squeezed out the body that occupied it before. Branches sprout from the facemask wildly, limbs protrude from the leg and armholes, and the entire chest piece is nearly bursting from the volume of foliage it contains.","44":"Just when its time to make camp for the night yet again within the damp cold forest, the party comes across an old house sitting unoccupied in a small clearing. They seek comfort in the house, building a fire in the hearth and drinking some old booze left by previous tenants. Keeping good watch, they peer out the windows frequently. Maybe it’s just the old wine but are the trees…. getting closer?","45":"A few chickens are pecking at the dirt in the middle of the trail. When you come upon them, you spook them, and they trot off into the forest a few meters. They resume pecking; but little does anyone know that they’ve begun to peck seeds that have the effect of the enlarge spell. Treat an enlarged chicken as an allosaurus and let the fun begin.","46":"Glowing eyes stare out of a knothole in an old and gnarled tree. When the players notice it watching, the thing scampers deeper into the tree. If they investigate the knothole they’ll find it goes deep, deeper than the tree itself. At the bottom of the hole something glitters. Gold? Many more glowing eyes stare up around it.","47":"A corpse sways in the branches of a lonely willow by a stream, dangling from a noose. The corpse is grinning, and dancing a slow, merry jig.","48":"Something howls in the distance. Another something responds. Not wolves. The howls are too ragged, sound too much like words.","49":"A little twig-and-twine doll is pinned to a branch up ahead. Another just like it can be seen just off the path, and another beyond that one. Even in the depths of the woods you’ll be protected so long as you follow them. Your safety once you arrive where they’re leading you is less guaranteed. A polite invitation has been extended. It won’t come again.","50":"Moaning can be heard from a bush. Within is a hunter, near-death, near incoherent from fear. No mere animal could have inflicted the wounds he bears. They’re too precise, suggestive of strange symbols.","51":"The trees in this part of the forest are all wrong. They’re growing in neat rows; they sway though there is no wind. Strange fruits swell in their boughs. You’ve stumbled into an orchard. Were those stones you stepped over a ways back someone’s fence?","52":"A boar bursts out of the undergrowth; foaming spittle flecks its tusks. It charges, eyes bloodshot, but makes no move to defend itself. All its attacks seem half-hearted. What drove this beast to seek death so?","53":"Cloying mist drifts into the region. You can barely see five paces ahead of you. Vague, bulbous forms can be seen protruding from the trees as you pass. Fungus. This isn’t mist, it’s spores.","54":"A fire shines through the trunks a little ways from you. Around it are adventurers, like you, camping for the night. None of them speak the same languages as you. The forest has them spooked, paranoid. They’ll welcome familiar company at first, but any number of things you do could set them off.","55":"A pond in a clearing, clean and still. No animal drinks from it, no insects buzz above it. No monsters will approach here beyond the tree line. Is it safe for you to stay here?","56":"The forest path is narrow and overgrown. Looking down the tunnel-like trail gives you vertigo and puts you off balance. Shadows appear to move and you feel like you’re just going in circles.","57":"The forest itself seems to be against your presence. Roots seem to spring up to trip you and branches swat at you when moved out of the way. The canopy closes around you shutting out the sunlight.","58":"The players hear footsteps echoing theirs, slightly behind, but the path is empty. Anything they call out is repeated back with missing syllables, as if the voice is in pain.","59":"A child’s laughter is heard off of the path, along with a flicker of light, which keeps appearing further away if the party follows. It leads them to the body of an elven boy with an arrow in his back.","60":"One member of the party hears the creaking of the trees and sounds of the forest suddenly stop, then a voice right behind them whispers their name on a hoarse voice, but there is no one there. None of the others notice anything different.","61":"The players hear the sounds of cries and screams from soldiers and the guttural cries of a nightmarish creature echo through the forest. The last one goes quiet before they reach them. If they choose to search, they find scattered around the ground the weather-worn skeletal remains of 16 soldiers from a long-dead empire known for it’s brutal methods, some of which are found ripped apart apparently trying to flee.","62":"The players feel as though something is watching them, but can’t see anything in the darkness. If they move more than 30ft in any direction they hear rustling following, but no matter how much they search cannot find anything.","63":"A dead character from one of the character’s past stands amongst the trees, with the appearance and wounds they had when they died. Only one person can see them. The character doesn’t move, but silently watches the player. Any attacks go through them without causing damage. They dissolve into a smoke-like darkness after 1d6 minutes.","64":"The sound of whispering is heard behind a bush. When it is pulled back or someone moves behind it, the whispering stops abruptly and a darkened feather falls slowly to the ground.","65":"A group of little girls are tied to the trees just off of the path, crying quietly. If the party goes to rescue them, they fight being rescued and attempt to escape and retie themselves to the trees, warning that ‘the Grogleman’ will come for them and their families too if they return home.","66":"A group of giants sit motionless around a giant chessboard, eyes intent on the pieces. Closer examination reveals the three are corpses; fungi grow from their eyelids and out of their hair, and the bodies slump and collapse if touched.","67":"The ground on both sides of the trail seems odd; upon closer examination, it is absolutely swarming with termites, covering the whole ground like a wave. If the party steps off the trail, the insects scatter from the party’s feet, leaving strange, momentary footprints in the ground.","68":"Prayers cannot be uttered aloud in the forest; spells can be cast as normal, but any verbal component comes out as a rattling hiss.","69":"A thick fog hovers over the ground, reaching up about two feet (to the chests of any halflings in the party, to the knees of humans). Anyone putting their heads in the fog (bending down to pick something up, etc.) hears muffled screams and far-off voices begging for their lives.","70":"Each person awakes to find a large meat hook carefully placed along on their bedrolls over their stomachs.","71":"In the periphery of the party’s vision, the trees that they pass seem to take on the image of a grim army, marching next to the party. When faced directly, the trees seem rather normal. The whole forest smells like a battlefield.","72":"Every time anyone lights a fire in the forest, there is a sudden hissing and smoking from the ground for twenty feet around the sparks. Little red lines appear like veins in the earth before fading to blackness.","73":"A monkey in a Jester’s costume comes swinging through the trees, hooting and screeching. If the adventurers catch the monkey, they find a bloody knife stuck in its belt. The monkey stares at them all with a baleful expression.","74":"Crows are screaming at each other as the party enters the woods. Increasingly, the screams sound like words, demanding blood.","75":"The hedge on the side of the trail has strange burn marks in it, almost exactly in the shape of men.","76":"A fox with a bloodied and broken leg comes limping up the path to the party and will pass by it if it can. If anyone speaks to it, the fox changes form into an old druidic woman, who mumbles about the forest being unsalvageable.","77":"As the party walks into the forest, they are greeted by an adventuring group coming the opposite direction. They chat for a little bit, explaining they found the woods too dangerous and are making their way back to whatever town the party has just come from. A little farther into the woods, the party finds the corpses of the same adventuring group, gathered around the sputtering embers of a fire…","78":"A bucket has been nailed to a tree, with a crude sign saying ‘Donations’ hanging under it. The bucket is half-filled with fingers and toes in varying levels of freshness.","79":"A small, neat signboard reads, ‘Please remain on the path.’ The neatness is somewhat marred by the corpses strewn below the sign.","80":"Someone has sharpened the branches around the trail in the forest, so that the trail is surrounded by sharp points.","81":"The party finds themselves staring at a strange tableaux- the corpse of a squirrel is placed next to an acorn, followed by (in order) the corpse of a cat, a dog, a wolf, and a bear. Behind the bear are strange scuffmarks in the dirt, like there was another corpse behind it, this one in the shape of something human…","82":"As the party walks through the forest, a strange figure suddenly drops from the trees in front of them- upon inspection, it is an effigy in the rough shape of a man, made of wooden boughs and leaves. This happens twice more as they walk. The fourth time, the figure drops down again, but anyone going to clear it away finds that it is actually the corpse of a man this time, with branches lashed to his limbs and a grisly smile on his face…","83":"A cold mist creeps into the surrounding area, players who breathe it will be asked to make a roll (perception, nature, etc.) but they’re making a constitution save with whatever modifier from the false roll. Anyone who rolls above a set DC inhales the mist and is subject to strange illusions.","84":"A hanged man rests on a lone tree. His pockets lined with petty change and a note that appears to be an apology letter to his family.","85":"For an hour of travel there’s no sound other than the party.","86":"A section of the forest has been frosted over in what appears to be a permanent winter. The center appears to have an unnatural cave of rocks that don’t match anything of the surrounding geological features. Inside features a drop that appears to be without end.","87":"A small portal opens up about 15 ft. above the party, expelling a blood lusted demon to the ground below. It bounces, stunned momentarily before it acquires a new target.","88":"A large head-sized knot in a tree resembles a human face. Wait! The eyes are real: wide, staring, terrified eyes! They look at you as you approach, flicking to each person that talks. But they cannot blink (so cannot communicate in that way), but constantly weep a watery sap.","89":"A large open area. The dirt seems fresher than the rest, no grass growing on the surface. The trees around the edge of the grove are burnt. In the middle sits (1d4) huge skulls, each at least 5 times the height of an average human. These skulls have gashes and claw marks in them, as well as huge spiraling or pointed horns. Scratched into the largest one is ‘entrance’ in infernal. If the player puts their ear to the ground and listens, they can faintly hear a low rumble that unnerves them to their very core and they don’t know why. Digging downwards could potentially reveal a connection between the material plain and one of the evil-aligned outer plains.","90":"The first character to awaken sees a grotesquely exaggerated face hovering inches from their own, glowing weakly with an internal light. An ear-to-ear grin splits the face, revealing a maw with three rows of serrated teeth. When the character blinks, the face disappears. It never appears again.","91":"The party comes across perfectly circle clearing. It’s barren waste, nothing ever grows there. Any flora the party might bring with them instantly wilts as it crosses the border. No animal, even as faithful as ranger’s companions, can be forced to cross into that circle. If the party decides to spend a night there, they will wake up outside the circle, with all their things scattered across the outer rim of the clearing. If they do it on the night of winter solstice, they will wake up in Avernus instead.","92":"The trees suddenly grow until the sun is blocked out and a magical darkness is cast from somewhere, and whenever the players talk, they hear their words repeated to them in their voice, but can’t tell where it’s coming from.","93":"The players slowly realize that they are on a loop in the forest. Every night they make camp, then wake up with supplies returned and make the exact same journey again. The players must find the source of this curse and free themselves.","94":"While the party makes camp, someone notices that there is an additional person around the fire. How did no one notice? Why does it smell like rotten meat? And why is it looking at the barbarian like that?","95":"In a less dense part of the forest, where moonlight pours through, the party witnesses a strange hulking creature (Mothman) perched on a tall tree. Its giant red eyes watch the party for a moment, before the creature flies away. The party sees the creature a few more times before coming to a large bridge built over a dangerous river. The creature appears one more time over head, just as the bridge collapses.","96":"After camping in the woods the party awakens to find the trees around them whipping and lashing as if buffeted by strong winds, though the party feels not even a faint breeze. Upon closer inspection, the party notices in mounting horror that the shadows cast by the trees are in the shape of human beings writhing in silent agony.","97":"The party comes across a 50ft circle of pitch-black darkness, with no logical reason as to its existence. Any players that cannot see when in such conditions hear whispers and chattering while in this area, and take 1d6 slashing damage for every round spent there. Any players that can see in such conditions (ex. darkvision) will not suffer any of these effects, and will see that nothing is attacking the others, but rather the wounds are manifesting onto them.","98":"You see corpses pinned to the sharpened boughs and branches of the tress around you, wood puncturing through their throats and sternums. The mottled moonlight filtering through the slowly swaying leaves gives them an eerie sense of motion. A sudden scampering and swish of branches punches through the soft rustling of the trees. Wherever you turn, the sound seems to be coming from behind you, getting closer and closer till you feel a hot, wet breath on the back of your neck. You swing around to confront the horror and see nothing but the corpses in the canopy, leering down at you like demonic piñatas.","99":"The party stumbles upon a clearing, with a post stamped into the ground. A message scrawled in Primordial reads about a treasure found in the hidden home of squirrels. With a few investigation checks, the party finds an odd tree. Around the back of the tree is a poorly hidden, though hidden, door. The door has no lock on it, but is not open; it has a feeling as though it is stuck. It can be forced open, or pried open, or cut open with fairly decent resistance. Inside is a staircase leading downward, lit by candles embedded in the tree that don’t seem like they’re burning the tree, though they are quite bright. After a 5-minute descent, the staircase ends in what appears to be a basement. The ceilings drip, and the room is damp and warm. (You can also narrate that the stairs are slippery, and have your players roll athletics not to slip). A decent perception roll can see that the floor and ceiling leak the warm water, without much of a source, while a really good perception check will notice that the color of the environment has become darker, and has a reddish tinge. Otherwise, there appears to be a library or study (whichever is easier for you to narrate.) There are no loose papers or pens and all of the books appear to be locked up, so that they cannot be taken out. A chest in the back can be found, a hair too conspicuously. Upon opening it, there is nothing inside but a pit, that smells of vomit and acid. With that, the room begins to shrink, slowly. The party should discover that they’re in the mouth of a giant mimic, who is swallowing them. Upon escaping, the entire tree uproots itself, spits and snarls at the players, and runs away. Best described if you can drop hints about descending the gullet of a beast, such as a hot draft, or distant gurgling.","100":"The party makes camp, and partway through the night, someone on watch starts to get an off feeling. Depending on perception rolls, they may or may not see the eyes watching from up in the trees, though they disappear just after being noticed. Additionally, they may hear the sound of leathery wings gliding through the air above them. Finally, after their defenses being lightly probed/tested, a creature attacks. (IIRC)I used a giant flying chupacabra from PF, but whatever works for you. The creature goes down relatively easily, but as it is struck down, it lets out a piercing scream. As quiet settles, the party hears answering cries from deeper in the woods."}},"Tavern Encounters":{"type":"Text","results":{"1":"Tonight is the 10th annual Dragonfire Drinking contest!

Well connected with the black market, his inventory usually includes vast varieties of weapons, banned arrow or bolt types, exotic poisons or potions, illicit ingredients, and dangerous magic items. Every bit of available space on the inside of his coat and on his vest is taken up either by his wares or by pockets of holding for more of his wares. Every step he makes is accompanied by a cacophony of clanks as the small army’s worth of weapons jostle. With a casual gesture he’ll hold open his coat, putting his collection on full display and he’ll ask in a gravelly voice that sounds like a man who smoked tobacco since the day they were born, “What’re ya buyin’, stranja?”","46":"Malinda Farfoot: An exuberant halfling woman with free flowing dark brown hair that falls down to the middle of her back. Her bright blue eyes sparkle with the joy of someone following their passion and love sharing it with others. She smiles eagerly and warmly despite the jagged scar that runs diagonally across her face from temple to jaw line. She has a belt that holds knives, spoons, ladles, forks, and all manner of culinary tools. She travels with a muscular donkey that moves fairly silently considering all of the pots, pans, and other implements it is hauling. Malinda offers exotic recipes that use rare materials usually taken from monsters. She also offers to prepare any item as long as you bring her the materials, pay a relatively modest fee, and let her keep a portion for herself. She will only divulge how she got her scar with those she has developed a good relationship with.","47":"Unique Mulumba: A mysterious traveler from the distant south. He has coarse black hair and dark brown eyes. When you don't encounter him on the road, he can usually be found napping under a nearby tree, or in his small wagon. If you catch Unique while he's awake, he is always up for listening to tales from your adventures. He is good natured and laughs a bit too hard at most jokes. On (far) more than one occasion, an adventurer made him laugh while he was drinking something, and more of that drink ended up on the adventurer than in Unique. For all his carefree attitude, under it all, he came from a childhood of being a child soldier and knows how to take care of himself. He has basic traveling supplies, an extra tent or two, food rations, and always has his coffee.","48":"The Teeth Merchant: A very small looking creature who appears before adventurers after trekking through a perilous forest or plundering a deep dungeon, and asks if it has any teeth. If the party offers it teeth they got from some kind of monster, it unfurls (kind of like the grinch making That Face?) its arms and plucks it from them, before unfurling their body and showing them their coat full of magical trinkets, and will offer them a magical trinket of equal value (DM's discretion). After the initial encounter, The Teeth Merchant trades with the party as though with any merchant, but just with teeth instead of gold pieces.","49":"Mudpin: A middle-aged Verdan salesman. He normally sells items for Druids, Artificers and Bards. His wares include a variety of potions, staves, totems, foci, various parts for tinkering, crystals, small musical instruments and assorted home décor. Atop Mud's teal-painted cart is the hollowed-out and dried head of a dead Remorhaz. 'Disclaimer,' he says, 'I did NOT kill that thing.'","50":"Quansee't the Magi: A variety of different merchants who vary wildly in appearance, except for one distinctive feature; a bright blue cloak with gold accents. Each time the PCs come across a new Quansee't, they will act as if they have never met the party before. However, if they choose to barter with Quansee't, they will be selling certain items that they bought from the party earlier. Is Quansee't a shapeshifter, or is something weird going on?","51":"The Traveling Scam: Nickname for a doppelganger (either the monster or just a talented person disguising themselves with magic or costumes) going from place to place. They disguise themselves as other well-known merchants and offer to sell fake magical items and treasured pieces of art. When given the chance encounter with a poor person traveling the land or an injured adventurer in need of help, they will help the person out through all means necessary, whether it be through payments to help them purchase land or by administering medical care.","52":"Harold the Hunchbacked Haberdasher: A short hobbled little man pulling a cart with various, nice-looking though utterly mundane hats. Will try incessantly to get anyone he meets to buy something off him or indeed attempt to buy one of the hats they are currently wearing. Unfortunately he has a mild speech impediment preventing him from pronouncing the letter 'h'.","53":"Dulluen: A Half-Orc traveling in a small caravan. He plays sad tunes on his guitar, humming in a low raspy voice rolling slowly from one village to another. He has lots of stories full of wonders and mystery to share. The inside of his caravan is full of interesting curiosities, necessities (rope, pickaxe, lanterns, soap...) and some rare magic items hidden in a corner. It smells of sage, incense and cigars.","54":"Vulnebirus: An excommunicated paladin traveling for redemption for his sins. The order he belongs to condemns all oathbreakers to sell the equipment of their past lives, vowing to silence and humility. Dressed only in tattered rags, he carries his past gear on his back, tied to a sort of reliquary rising above his head. In the center is tied his blessed armor, on the right his trusted mace, on the left his battered shield. Various holy books, sacred vials and religious icons are scattered about the wooden structure. Vulnebirus will refuse to speak under all circumstances, and if he successfully sells all of his possessions, he will promptly journey to spend the rest of his life in a far off monastery of his god.","55":"Zalsregaar: A spellcasting drifter selling all sorts of magic paraphernalia. His hyper personality can be a lot to deal with, being particularly aloof and unpredictable. Often seen resting under a mossy log, in a wet ditch, hidden in dewy vegetation, he always smells of mold and spices. He carries his wares in a leather bag covered in fungus and will offer them to anyone within eyesight. If a customer appears, he will be able to buy parchment, potions, healing balms, soothing herbs and vision mushrooms, enchanted trinkets and magical ingredients along with sticks, pinecones, leafs and nuts bark found on the forest floor, all at reasonable prices.","56":"Floppsy Trillsinger: Gnome Bard Performer Extraordinaire. Travels the land in a dual horse drawn vardo that folds down into an impromptu stage, complete with miniaturized set pieces and costumes to perform one of three one-man shows: The Lady's Folly, The Addled Knight, A Bard's Lament. (Perfect NPC for a Harper (FR) or Grinner (CR) type spy)","57":"Durlin Deerstalker: Upon outward appearance, one might be intimidated by Durlin. Durlin is one of the finer hunters in the land. He grew up fending for every scrap of food his family ate. War and disease had brought disaster to their land, so Durlin learned to hunt and scavenge for anything remotely edible, mostly by trial and error. His older brother taught Durlin how to make dried meat, meager vegetables, and herbs into the best stews. As food became more plentiful, Durlin decided to use his skills to make money. His skins and meats are always cut properly, and he sells excellent roots and foods, but it's his herbs that are the real treasure.","58":"Eckerd the Brave: Eckerd doesn't stay in one place for very long, his house keeps burning down. That's the life of an experimental potion-maker, though. One minute, the new potion of tremor sense is distilling nicely. The next minute, half of the kitchen is gone, along with most of the ground directly under the kitchen. When Eckerd's mobile cart rolls into town, everyone keeps a 10 foot distance for the first few minutes. But it's hard to keep away from Eckerd's natural enthusiasm. This wiry gnome, fitted in his least scorched tailcoat and tophat jumps at the chance to tell you about his latest invention. Let the buyer beware. Let the buyer's immediate neighbors beware.","59":"Claudia Smothersea: Claudia has been running the Smothersea tavern for four decades. It had been part of her late husband's family for generations. Claudia would have retired and given the tavern to her oldest son, Ellis, but the boy wanted to play soldier. After he enlisted, Claudia held out hope he would come home, but there hasn't been any word for two years. Her daughter, Clea, and younger son, Irwin, help her run the tavern now. It is busier now than when her in-laws ran the place. It might be in part because Clea is a shameless flirt, but it's Claudia's brewing recipes that bring people back. Horehound stout, hawthorn ale, wormwood bitter, and especially Goodberry mead make for many repeat customers.","60":"Euan Toller: Old Euan has spent as much time hammering steel as other people have breathing. Time and heat have grayed his hair and beard, but his back is strong as it was when he forged armor for his lord's father. Euan is a fair man, but his apprentices more often last weeks than months. Euan demands a work ethic as strenuous as his own, and does not believe in idling. A woodsman who buys an ax from old Euan will give that tool to his son.","61":"Marten Likker: As a young apprentice, Marten Likker was told by his master that he was most likely the world's worst hatter and that he would never amount to anything. With fierce determination, Marten sought out to prove his master wrong... by becoming the finest shoemaker in the land. Marten can craft a pair of boots that will last for a generation, or a pair of fine heels that will draw the attention of all royalty. His customers have come to expect long waits, prices one would rarely call 'competitive', and Marten's eccentricities such as a ban on hats in the shop. Heaven help the customer that criticizes his work, for they may be threatened with the loss of their toes.","62":"Ariel Knockturne: She is a young elf with a dream. A dream to create a carriage empire using centaurs as labor. Her fledgling business empire, Hoofin' It, has run into some early entrepreneurial issues including competition with other local carriage merchants and issues with the local Centaur union, Clip-Cloppers Local 104, who are threatening to strike over having to purchase their own shoes. As a result, Ariel has found herself deeply in debt and working with smugglers to bring illicit substances into town.","63":"Petrie Spires: He is getting too old to run a general store. This old merchant spent far too long working behind the counter; lifting heavy boxes, rude customers, not to mention the numerous times he’s been robbed. What Petrie is not tired of, is making money. Calling Petrie a cheapskate elicits the same response as calling him handsome. Once when he was robbed, the bandit panicked and shot Petrie in the leg with a hand bow. The next day, Petrie sold the arrow, still covered in his blood. Petrie is not a big fan of questions like “where did you get that ring?” And “why does this shield have so many holes in it?” Recently, Petrie realized he could solve all of his problems by purchasing golems to run the shop.","64":"The Duke: a massively overweight human sitting in the open backdoor of a cart, who turns up in places that make absolutely no sense for a regular trader to be. There are no tracks of horses or anything, but he sells fantastic dishes that grant minor benefits as well as whatever the PCs need currently.","65":"Tanner Smith: Dressed in sweat stained clothing an exasperated Tanner Smith futilely drags on the leads of a dusty camel train while muttering under their breath, 'What I wouldn't do for a couple good horses, hells even a donkey.' The camels are loaded with amphorae of spiced apricot wine, phials of exotic perfumes packed in straw filled crates, and bundles of rare incense. Tanner will happily trade some of these expensive goods for any other pack animals, provided you 'Get these damn camels out of my sight!'","66":"Morg Coalbuckle: From a distance you see smoke rising and hear the ringing of metal on metal. Rounding a curve in the road you find Morg Coalbuckle in a heavy leather apron hammering away at an anvil atop a stump beside their traveling forge, a roaring inferno in the belly of an iron golem shaped like an ox. Morg is a master blacksmith, and having forged the golem themselves, knows the secrets to animating metal. Now that you think about Morg's skin has a strange sheen to it too...","67":"The Pixie Express: A stable of pixies flitting around invisibly on enchanted hummingbirds happily willing to deliver a message or small parcel if one knows how to summon them: a saucer of sugar water and a few crumbs of cake left in the crook of a tree.","68":"N'vereye: A strange merchant, wearing a blindfold over his eyes and cultist robes, selling creepy-looking tomes. N'vereye is a star pact warlock who worships an Outer God, and always covers his eyes in order to keep his sanity intact. The strange books he sells contains lore and information of the outer realms and the Great Old Ones. If one were to buy one of his tomes, they take 1d6 psychic damage as it contains things that normal people could not comprehend. He's popular among other warlocks though.","69":"Rascal Garbageson: Some guy who sells stuff he finds in garbage cans for a very, very cheap price. Lies about his inventory being magically enchanted, and came from faraway lands. Don't be surprised if he sells a pile of dog poop one day.","70":"Boote Legg: A crazy woman who sells bootlegs of very rare magic items. Her stuff is all sloppily made and some might even break very easily, even though she proposes that they're the real deal.","71":"The Masked Tea Sommelier (Or the Tea Fox for short): An enigmatic figure that has the appearance of a young human woman with a theatrical fox mask and a short hanfu. She rides a penny-farthing that carries a passenger cart. The passenger cart carries an immaculate tea shop. It doesn't matter how rough the road is, the ceramic pots and cups are never disheveled or broken. She will occasionally stop on the road to offer travelers some tea and tell their fortune from their tea leaves (For a price, of course). No one knows her real name, origin, or what she looks like under the mask. After she finishes telling your fortune, she puts everything back in the carriage and rides off. Legends have been told about her for centuries so her true age is also a mystery.","72":"Professor Terracrus Halfang: A gnome book salesman who appears to be in his early 400's. He carries around a large backpack and has a surprising amount of books contained within. He has plenty of rare and banned books for sale in his collection and enjoys discussing politics, philosophy, and religion with other enthusiasts as well as his favorite fiction and adventure novels. He's even carried conversations about children's books as well. He's also willing to buy books that adventurers have written. On more than one occasion, he's even gotten them published and given them a cut of the proceeds.","73":"The Shadow Seller: A figure clad in plague doctor garbs is rumored to haunt roads near fresh battlefields and recent massacre sites. The figure rides a (skeletal) horse-drawn hearse and speaks in whispers. They sell a collection of macabre things such as mummified limbs, necrotic venomous spiders, books about the dead, tiny flesh golem familiars, and a collection of jars that they claim contain the souls of the dead. It's not clear how they get these souls but they somehow know which souls are important to someone. A dead lover, friend, or family member might find its way into their collection. The price for the more mundane morbid curiosities is priced in gold but the souls are offered in favors or tasks. Perhaps they want something from a necromancer's collection or a pale master's skeletal arm. For the more morally corruptible, they might ask for a much more wicked task. Anyone who has tried to fight the Shadow Seller has simply seen it vanish into a mist after the first blow is made.","74":"Brother Garrett Tumbledown: A half-hin (half-human, half-halfling) who dresses in a road worn, patchwork, ragged priest's garb and carries a backpack filled with everything a kitchen might need. He offers a delicious, home cooked meal to weary travelers for a fair price. He enjoys talking about his religion (NG light/holy-based god. Whatever works for your setting. Pelor, Lathander, Silver Flame, Bahamut, Sarenrae, Paladine, etc.) His food seems almost divinely enhanced. It can have a multitude of positive effects (Boost of temporary HP for 1d4 days, dispelling negative effects, recovering from fatigue. It's up to the DM.) He makes enough food for leftovers and wraps them up once the meal is finished. After the travelers finish their meals, the prestidigitation his utensils, gathers everything up, bids farewell, gives them an informal blessing, and continues on down the road.","75":"Akhissie: A pureblood yuan-ti woman who considers herself a 'Pharmacist' but she honestly just offers hallucinogens that allow for extraplanar astral projection (or at least the perception thereof). She's very laid back and carries her supplies in a knapsack and a series of pouches located on her overcoat. When she encounters travelers she asks them bizarre, nonsensical questions such as, 'Have you asked a god why their air tastes like fear-induced sadness?', 'When was the last time a person has said all the same exact things you said for an entire day but in a different language in another part of the world?', 'Do you think our eyes are different enough to give each other an entirely different perception of reality?', and 'What is it called when you recall a feeling you used to have at a time in your life as if it was a room you simply left but now it has a different feeling because you left it for too long?' No matter the adventurer's response, she just smiles and says, 'Far out...' Then she sells her wares, speaking in a similarly bizarre way.","76":"The Clay Brothers: These three Humanoids shaped out of clay may seem crude at first, but they are actually gold smiths of some renown. They work especially well on gemstone jewelry. Since they are made of clay and have a quite intimidating amount of strength, they practically carry around a small forge on their backs.","77":"Carvin Slowfellow: He is a male halfling in his later years. Gone bald, his gray beard is charred in places, stained in various colors in others. He wears a pair of discolored pants, no boots, a shirt and a black vest. Donning a pair of round glasses, he looks a bit unhinged. Carvin was blessed by Gond, God of Craft, with the gift of crafting and enchanting almost any items that come to mind. He fulfills this blessing by rapidly creating items of various powers, but they are usually unconventional to say the least. A Fishbowl of Silence for example, where the inside of the bowl has Silence enchanted into it. A bucket that despite your best efforts always returns to a spot by the door, when you look away. Edible flowers that taste like chocolate... but only the stem. Use Carvin to deliver your comedic relief items and trickle in some interesting homebrewed items that you know you always wanted the party to have!","78":"Gappo Shandeley: An old sailor and scrimshaw maker, he carves elaborate false-limbs for adventurers from the tusks, bones and chitin of slain creatures, occasionally paying for these cast-offs from particularly storied beasts. Has an unnerving way of looking at you, like he's constantly sizing you up, though whether that is to sell you a prosthetic -or to steal your bones for materials- is up to you. Wears a large floppy hat with elaborately-carved bones hanging from the rim, an advertisement for his skills.","79":"Loony Luna Braehler: A purveyor of exotic 'moon poetry', which she claims is sent to her by the moon using a 'tidal ouija-board'. Tall and gangly, with extremely long, tousled brown hair, upon which is threaded a hoard of cheap, gaudy moon-shaped paraphernalia. Her detractors claim the poetry is just her own, with a dodgy story to sell the bizarre readings, whilst her supporters claim that nobody sane would write such pointless nonsense. Nonetheless, highly regarded in divination circles as one to watch.","80":"Zin zu'la Zandras: From far off foreign land. Traveling peddler is considered the highest calling in his homeland. He seeks to gain favor and status for his house by finding goods and materials of indispensable value and offering it to the royal family. Players find him regularly robbed and his cart torched. He somehow manages to financially recover every time.","81":"Tavos: Tavos is quite the veteran, surviving a war between the planes. He’s gone to hell and back, quite literally, earning a numerous amount of scars on his human body. Tall, slender, and almost completely covering his body in masks and a black cloak, covering his scars, and his past, he now makes a living as a traveling merchant using his “spoils of war”, including powerful artifacts from his youth in war, useful connections from around the planes and dark contracts that he’s taken advantage of, and his tamed giant spider that obediently totes his large storage of items and himself on it’s back. He sources many things from the abyss, as few merchants would dare to compete in that market. He rarely talks about himself, only about business, and has a dark sense of humor. Also be careful, the spider bites, but Tavos will hold a grudge forever if you harm it, even in self defense.","82":"Fahir the Rugged: A wizened, dark-skinned man with sharp eyes and an even sharper tongue. This elderly trader reclines on his flying carpet as it whisks him to distant lands, and when it lands again, it's laden with intriguing trinkets and exotic spices. The real goods are his words - few others have Fahir's global perspective.","83":"Poosey the Butcher: This burly dwarf is pure muscle, and always has a few cleavers tucked behind his apron. He rolls his clattering abattoir-wagon into town, hires adventurers to hunt local game, breaks it down, and preserves it in a special Bag of Holding to sell to connoisseurs. From peacock cutlets to were-boar loin, if it's made of meat, Poosey probably has it... and if he doesn't, he'll hire you to bag it.","84":"Bandolier Sam Delgado: This half-elf gunslinger's adventuring days might be behind him, but retirement isn't really his style. Sam's handmade stagecoach unfolds into an open-air saloon, where folks gather to sip Dwarven smoking ale and sing folk songs late into the night. It's jam-packed on Sam's last day in town; the whole village turns out to watch his impressive trick-shooting routine as he twirls and blasts his exotic arquebuses.","85":"Cogmaster Kazoc: No one's sure who gave this clever gnome his ridiculous title, but he's not letting it go. His nimble fingers and keen magic certainly back it up. The moment he parks his caravan, he's plied with broken clocks, faulty lanterns, fizzling wands, and seized-up water wheels. He never sticks around for more than a week or two, but by the time he sets off, the town's machinery is whirring and purring. He doesn't like to brag, but if you prove your expertise, Kazoc will take you in back and show you his custom designs.","86":"Denthel: A copper dragon disguised as a small lizard merchant who is only interested in trading objects rather than gold pieces. Having learned from another pushy type of merchant, he sells all his belongings claiming them to be 'the best'. 'This longsword is the best!'","87":"K'zeyul Ragh: This witty and charismatic kobold merchant's life has been entirely devoted to dragonkind. Due to this, he mostly trades in anything and everything draconic, ranging from conserved dragon body parts to artifacts, books that talk mostly about dragons and maps that record the location of dragon lairs","88":"Leire Noul: An attractive-looking but overall seedy human lady in her late 20s that stocks a wide variety of exotic components used for rituals, books on occult subjects, various religious items and perhaps a spell scroll or two. However, she actually disdains religions and the occult, and is only in it for the money. She is very well versed in those subjects however, but only so that she can pretend she's deeply invested into whatever faith her patrons follow, in order to win them over and get them to spend more money on her goods than they would otherwise","89":"Clitter Clatter: A skittish kenku that only sells incomplete items he has come across in his travels. Goods on sale might include rope scraps, rough and incomplete maps, single Sending Stones (for example, a creature might carry the other stone, or it could've been dropped somewhere and adventurers might hear a particular noise that could eventually take them to it), Decks of Illusions or other similar card-related magic items with only 1d8+2 cards remaining in them, or flawed/damaged magic items that can only hold half the charges a normal version of that item would have. Also, he might buy similar items from the travelers for a better price than most merchants would normally pay for them","90":"Gwlop: A sentient, talking ooze that sells a wide assortment of items that it has 'found' (read: couldn't digest after consuming many overly trusting travelers) while on the road. Since it likes consuming the coins it's given as nourishment rather than keeping them around, it prefers being paid in copper whenever possible","91":"Grung: A human with rough factions and copious facial and body hair, who only wears animal skins for protection and barely speaks common (can't read or write). Rather than buying or selling, he only understands the concept of trading, and values items in a way that's entirely incomprehensible to anybody else. Whether this skewed value errs in favor of or against their patrons is up to the GM's discretion","92":"Eleanor de Corbyn: A small and brightly-clothed woman; a trader in futures. Though sighted, she wears a blindfold so that the visible world does not distract her from her visions. She looks into a customer's fate to foresee some good outcome, then offers to buy it away from the customer in exchange for a different boon. Or she foresees a disaster and offers to sell them a better outcome, in exchange for some different loss. If the PC takes her bargain, they should come close enough to the traded-away fate (and then have it snatched away) that they can tell (or at least suspect) that the deal was real.","93":"Vandross: An expressionless, iron-masked humanoid that is half mechanical, half biological that speaks in profound, if slightly violent rhymes. Remember to speak their name in ALL CAPS or they get agitated and refuse to sell until sufficient apology is made. An interplanar gemstone factor, and member of a powerful cartel of gem-dealers, has many connections, especially between several Elemental Mote settlements that border the Planes of Earth and Air, as well as several far-flung regions of the Astral Plane, the City of Brass, etc. They are willing to let adventurers and merchants tag along on their peregrinations, for a small gratuity, investment, or for reasons of plot, never spending more than ten days in a location or plane before plane-shifting to the next in a strange series of logistical conjunctions that would require a genius to work out a complete schedule for, if not for VANDROSS's Perfect Recall. Up to twenty sentient individuals and their gear, inside 76.3 cubic meters of volume, and massing no more than 20,000 kg may travel this way, the amount that would fit inside a standard Earth-based Shipping container. Their extensive web of connections could make it near impossible to purchase certain gemstones here on this plane, should the party cross them.","94":"Bephryn Omardiiren: A drow smuggler from a long-ago disgraced noble house. He now traverses between the underdark and the surface world, selling interesting trinkets, some magical. He travels the surface in a cart pulled by giant spiders illusorily disguised as horses.","95":"Enneff Te'a: Buys, or rather collects obscure or powerful magic items; sells nothing but Certificates of Ownership of magical items, and also the souls of others. They say they keep the item or soul in a vault in a demiplane under their control, but tell everyone else that you own it, they promise.","96":"Niya: A mysterious masked woman who sells shrunken heads. Some have been enchanted with Alarm spells that will cause them to scream when triggered.","97":"Faranni Orama: A middle-aged elven woman who has recently made the decision to leave her homeland and travel the world. She is writing a book on Alchemy and will gladly buy any unique herbs that the party has picked up on their travels. She sells a variety of rare potions.","98":"Azarg Yak: An older orc male who sells beast skins that he collects on his travels. He is currently working on a cape made from wolf pelts, but he has run out of materials. If the party can bring him some wolf pelts, he will make them a set of capes.","99":"Fili Diamondhide: Fili is a 232 year old dwarf who is traveling the realm with her husband Trundum Diamondhide. Trundum is suffering from a horrible disease and is only given a short amount of time to live. His dying wish was to see the world. Fili funds their travels by selling homemade jewelry (which are incredibly beautiful!). If the party is able to cure Trundum of his disease, the couple will be forever in their debt.","100":"Uroxan Lorfras: Uroxan is a dragonborn yak dealer. He is seen traveling the countryside with 1d10+3 tamed yaks. He is a very patient man who has trained hundreds of yaks over the years."}}},"items":{"Ancient Holy Relics":{"type":"Magic Item","results":{"1":"Orichalcum Fiddle: An inscription upon this golden colored metal fiddle made of celestial wood and strings of fine orichalcum reads the name of at least one demigod of music, mirth, and or dance.. the trouble is, everyone who reads the inscription reads a different name. A cleric of the named deity may, 1d3 times per day, use it to cast Irresistible Dance. Anyone not affiliated with the deity may attempt a Medium-Hard DC Religion and a Hard Performance check (using this fiddle) to cast the same spell up to 1d3 times per day. Failing either check results in temporarily losing a level for one month.","2":"Gno's Picker: This is, surprisingly, a relic of a church of [Music Deity]. It is the finger bone of a once great Bard/Cleric, Gno Adagio, who wrote many hymns, poems, and writings about [Music Deity]. It was excavated, cleaned, and made into a pick for a lute/guitar per their request upon death. It is said any melody played with it is sure to catch the ear of the gods.","3":"The Khaen of Bes: a simple and unassuming clay and bamboo, free-reed aerophone resembling a cross between an ocarina, a harmonica, and a pipe organ. The khaen covers four octaves, in a diatonic scale. Up to 1d6 times per day, used to cast Knock, the instrument can open any door or opening, even going so far as to be able to cause a seal of up to five feet of solid stone to crumble to dust (although doing so uses all remaining charges, minimum 3)! Alternatively, while being played, as an action, (for up to 10 minutes per charge) the pipes have the effect of Turn Undead at 120 foot range, and with a saving throw DC of 12+Wis Bonus+Proficiency Mod.","4":"The Marquise of Vavasor He Ji: A fist-sized marquise-cut Alexandrite in a platinum and ruby studded cage atop a long staff. Wielded by a neutrally aligned caster, after attunement for 24 hours, in bright light, this relic projects a 10 foot radius circle region within 100 feet of the staff. Sentient creatures within the circle at the start of their turn must WIS save DC (10 + Casting Ability Mod + Prof Bonus) or be compelled with ongoing feelings of seething envy. Until they save, affected targets turn upon the nearest creature (whether an ally or enemy) and attempt to disarm it of a valuable weapon, steal something it is holding, grapple it and strip it of something it prizes, or enter combat and attempt to kill it (your choice). Affected targets can attempt a new save each round at the end of their turn. Alternatively, 1d4 times per day, the marquise may instead end an enchantment effect (selected at random) on a single target as if casting Dispel Magic at Level 3+1d3; this effect may not be used on the same day as the Envy effect. Attempting to use the opposing effect on the same day has no effect.","5":"The True Mask of St Loque: An androgynous porcelain mask that St Loque was famously known to wear at all times. The origin is unknown, but the visage is embedded in the minds of those saved at the saint’s hands. Many duplicates can be found, but this is the true mask. Promise.","6":"The Thyrsus: This staff is wound with ivy and sprouts flowers at random intervals. It is a +3 quarterstaff that allows the user to cast confusion at will.","7":"A Gilt-Covered Earthenware Pot-Shard of Opiconsivia: It is said that a Demigod of Protection, Plenty, and Prosperity once graced a modest party celebrating both a wedding, birth, and a funeral, in a small isolated village in the distant mountains just after harvest. A traveling priest recognized the deity, and offered them libations from the earthenware pot. In thanks, the deity blessed the simple pot and the wine in the pot never ran out, instead turning into Ambrosia! The party turned into such a rager that fully half of the town remained drunk, after weeks of revelry that only ended when someone accidentally broke the pot. The surviving priest noted, despite many dying early from alcohol poisoning, the village never went hungry or had an instance of plague for the next 30 years. Now, the potshard has been gilded, and when immersed for one year and one day, in up to 50 gallons of wine or hard liquor, along with 25 gp per gallon, the booze transforms into Holy Booze, liquor that doubles as Holy Water, and always tastes of the finest vintage, no matter how lowly to begin with, and never gives a hangover.","8":"The Everburning Candle of Luminos: This light blue candle never melts, no matter how long the wax is left burning.

The rest of the text is a mish-mash of glyphs in Infernal and Abyssal, containing many, many, many terrible jokes from the nine hells, as well as a legalistic and confounding diagram on every 9th foot of the scroll. Although the scroll doesn't say to, if one reads a specific numbered glyph from each jape according to the diagrams, one can construct over 111,111,111 jokes, japes, and jibes as confoundingly funny as the ones before it, although doing so may profoundly affect one's sanity after prolonged use. As an action, up to 1d6 times per day, creatures with an INT of 5 or more, within 60 feet that can see or hear the wielder must WIS save or be affected by the Spell Hideous Laughter for up to 1d6 minutes; those that save take 3d6 psychic damage (but may attempt to resist half this damage with a CON save).","45":"The Broken Helm of Lumitor, the Mortal Weapon of Pellor: Once per day the helm can be placed in bright sunlight and summon the ghost of Lumitor to fight for what is good and just for one minute.","46":"Balar's Consecrated Eye: After the Celestial realm defeated the Fomorian Demon-Lord named Balar of the Piercing Gaze, its oversized ruby eye was taken up by the Great Consecrated Weaponsmith Tubal. The heat contained in the eye was such that even after being immersed in holy water for 111 years, it was not destroyed. Tubal, with great skill, managed to etch holy runes upon each of 777 facets of the basketball-sized ruby, and encased the hateful thing in a cage made of adamantine and orichalcum, turning it into a weapon. The artifact floats and slowly orbits the head of the attuned wielder. 1d3 times per day, as a bonus action, the Eye may used to cast the spell Sunbeam, except it fires a line up to 120 feet long, and it deals 6d10 radiant damage instead, igniting flammable objects in the line as well (dealing 2d6 fire damage each turn until extinguished).

The coven would later grow into the church and thus enshrine Sir Gustos fork as a holy relic.","56":"The Slate of [Deity]: Although now a collection of shards that appear to be made of stone slate, legend says when a great prophet was teaching his first followers about [Deity], he wrote and taught on a slab of slate provided by a celestial solar themselves. However, in a great war (also ancient) an attacking force smashed the slate upon the ground. The pieces were recovered, and are now kept in a small, ornate box with no known opening or puzzle.

The bell was said to be able to comply even a Greater Demon to speak truth if the entire ritual encoded by the runes were enacted, a feat requiring a 40 divine casters undergo a 40 day and night vigil of chanting each of the runes, procession, and holy purification to utilize its true power.

The revered devotee who did the guiding is unknown as the conch was found left on the lap of the goddess's statue at the harbor.

It is unclear why, but a village of Grung have been compelled to keep it safe on an alter and keep it under protection of traps. In an emergency, they will rush for this and hide it.

The appearance of the tablet is dangerously deceptive; attempts to extract the tablet have revealed that the space within the orb is distorted, the tablet is nigh-on infinitely large, and equally far away, and the stormy sea within the orb is effectively boundless. Despite the miraculous nature of the orb, to-date no arch-scholar or -mage has ever been able to coax more than a gallon of brine from the sea within, any more simply dis-apparates within seconds, leaving nothing behind. The attuned user of the orb gains the following abilities: 1) At will, may cast Waterbolt (a cantrip similar to firebolt, except it deals bludgeoning damage instead and generates about 1 gallon of water per bolt, with each previous bolt dis-apparating upon firing the next.); 2) Up to a number of times per day equal to their proficiency modifier, as an action, use the Large Water Elemental's Whelm ability on a number of square adjoining theirs (up to their proficiency modifier), sustained by concentration, or up to 10 minutes. and 3) Once per day, may cast Storm Of Vengeance; any liquids generated by the casting also dis-apparate once the effect ends.","74":"The Skull of St Haines: After sacrificing himself in a ritual to banish the undead king once and for all, the mortal remains of St Haines were distributed to all the holy temples and churches of St Haines.

The person buried in that grave was average, but the life that emerged from the grave was a great champion of their order.","78":"Seshat's Abacus: An attuned user holding this abacus can track the number of deaths that occur within 60 feet of them and assign the individual who is most responsible for the death, a token (which takes the form of small, carved bone polyhedra with inscribed with inscrutable runes upon each face. Followers of Seshat often display their tokens by wrapping them in gold wire and wearing them as jewelry. Each time an enemy creature is killed that is equal to or at a higher Level or Challenge Rating than the one that the attuned user of the abacus deems responsible for the killing, the abacus awards them a token. If the holder of the abacus cannot determine the one responsible for the kill, no token may be awarded. A creature may not have more tokens than their proficiency bonus. Assigning a token requires the attuned user investigate the scene of the battle for at least 3d6 minutes per token to be awarded, and the inspection must occur within 24 hours of the kill, and the individual to receive the token must remain within 60 feet of the attuned user for the duration of the inspection. The attuned user may not award more tokens than their proficiency bonus each day. The size of the token to be awarded is equal to the nearest dice size equal to or less than the attuned user's level (at the time of the kill), or the level of the individual receiving the token (at the time of the kill), whichever is lesser (+1 at Lvl 1, +1d2 at Lvl 2, +1d4 at Lvl 4, +1d6 at Lvl 6, +1d8 at, +1d10 at Lvl 10, +1d12 at Lvl 12, +1d20 at Lvl 20). Before the result of a roll is announced, the holder of a token may spend it, adding the value of that token to their roll. Once used, the token disappears. No more than one token may be used per encounter; attempting to use a token when one has been used already in the encounter results in the token instead being awarded to one's opponent. Tokens may not be otherwise exchanged. A creature may not gain a token in the same encounter where they have used one. The bearer of this abacus has a weighty burden upon their shoulders; should Seshat determine an abacus holder to be corruptly awarding tokens, divine retribution invariably occurs.","79":"The Staff of Saint Anselm: 7 1/2 foot long staff made from the branch of a willow tree. Immediately after a being has held the staff and moved 1 mile, on their next turn, they will enlarge to double their original height/next size category, and the staff will enlarge proportionately.

If an ally is already forced to make death-saves, they neither succeed nor fail at them, instead remaining in a sort of suspended animation; taking damage or being attacked while suspended does not cause a failed death save, but the target does continue to accumulate damage. Should the music stop, at the end of the round, all deferred damage is applied to the victim, and the consequences of receiving said damage take immediate effect. If the victim was making death-saves, this applied damage must be healed before the victim can recover; they remain unconscious and must continue making death-saves until brought above 0 hp.","83":"The Oven of Kamutef: A medium sized earthenware oven, now gilded and placed upon a set of iron rods to be carried in procession, is decorated in carved, ornate motifs featuring Lactuca Serriola, a type of wild, prickly lettuce; the Sun, and flails.

An ornate, decorated censer made entirely from a single emerald the size of a basketball, this priceless dwarven artifact is supported by a mithril pole that itself is finely and intricately engraved with a peerless record of use in a nearly lost dialect of ancient dwarven, although one would need a jeweler's loupe and good light to resolve the fine (but slightly verbose) markings indicating the lineage and circumstances of any that use it and when (great for gripping though!). The length of the pole magically increases to store the information, although there is also likely some divine spatial shortening shenanigans going on, the pole currently is ten feet long and is rather unwieldy, but the record is several thousand years long. Once per day, the attuned user of the censer may cast Cloudkill. Additionally up to once per hour, the attuned user may cast Silence (even if they themselves are silenced) by burning a bit of incense worth at least 1 gp; finally, any individual within (and under the effect of) the smoke generated by Silence may, up to a number of times per day equal to their proficiency modifier, choose to re-roll any INT based skill, check, or save (before the results of the roll are resolved), but if they do so, they must take the new result, even if it is lower.","95":"The Devourer’s Jaw(Shield): When the user is attacked with a melee weapon, as a reaction, they can destroy the non-magical weapon used in the attack.

It contains dozens of powerful rituals for summoning deadly natural disasters, including plagues, earthquakes, tsunamis and hurricanes.","13":"'The All Knowing Tome': This strange tome seemingly knows information about almost any topic. Whenever it is opened it displays everything it knows about a topic the reader is looking for. However, every minute it is being read, the reader must make a WIS save (DC 15 +1 per minute reading past the first minute). On a failed save, their soul is ripped from their body and stored in the book, along with all of their knowledge.

The pages, which are of a parchment that is rough and unsettling to the touch, appear to its reader to be entirely blank. It is only when the reader cuts themselves and drips blood on the pages that the words are revealed; and much blood is required to read the whole thing. Many are the foolish who have expired from self exsanguination or cumulative trauma in order to 'read just one more page' ...","22":"'Anatomy of the Sunsweaters': Roughly translated from Undercommon, this book is a biological and highly racist work depicting the anatomy of humans through the lens of a dark elf who has an ever-specific repulsion against all life that willfully exposes itself to the sun. The book has been translated by an aspiring doctor, who has taken the liberty to add his own lecture notes and oddly enough defend the dark elf biologist's profane hostility. He keeps reminding the reader that cultural differences are not to be judged, that he wished that he had been there and that he quite likely enjoys the fantasy to be dissected alive by a dark elf.","23":"'Mnemotical Magic': This tome has moving pictures of funny situations and animals. Which seems like a humorous pass-time soon reveals that the magically animated graphics are powered by the souls of those that are depicted. Directing an open page to a person will also make them repeat the depicted action, that is if the page shows a dog wagging its tail, people whom the owner of the book shows the picture will feel urged to go on all fours jumping. Seeing an image of an orc who slips and falls into their own ax will make people want to hold their weapon out awkwardly and fall over to also be injured in that way.","24":"'A Treaty on Flesh: The Collected Works of Ab'Dharr': The dark green leather bound tome of vellum paper, this book is the fanatical collecting and redistribution of the work of Amnu Ad'Dharr; the Perverter of Form. The book is a collection of recovered, reclaimed and recreated copies of the numerous experiments carried out by Ab'Dharr.

The original material takes the form of scientific essays or experiment logs, where a problem will be proposed and a full catalog of the steps taken to try to create a workable solution. The problems presented as such as 'Can the deficit in cognitive function of necromantic flesh constructs be circumnavigated?'. To which the paper goes onto outline creating a 'spiritual hivemind' which links the limited functions of all individuals; including 'properly fashioned intellectual stock'.

The book is said to have been in the position of a Wendigo for several decades before coming to rest in Blackoak Restorative Manor for the Mental Infirm. The only legible content within the book is a series of signatures on the back page; believed to have been former owners of the volume. To date, every owner of the book has either died of starvation regardless of financial means or physical health. Or has descended into the depths of animal savagery and cannibalism. Some anecdotal records at Blackoak from patient interviews suggest the book contains the last rational thoughts of all its previous owners. However, as these testimonies come from individuals who would go on to own the volume themselves or succumb to the harsh nature of their treatments; they are discredited among learned individuals.","26":"'The Convergent Truth': The Convergent Truth is a detailed explanation about why the plane you are in right now is a demi-plane, an exact copy of the material plane, used to lure something called The Devourer away from the true material plane. In the back of the book are commendations to this reality, each from a different volume of this book.

As the author writes the heavily researched stories, it becomes clear that with each new revelation described within, the author's madness and envy of the Forsaken grows. Quickly, the documentary writing shifts into more of a manual of praise and worship, detailing the dark rites of the path that the Forsaken walked. At the conclusion of the book, it is revealed that the binding of the book is none other than the flayed skin of Bertram Wondles himself. This book radiates a subtle but insidious evil that corrupts readers and holders alike.","29":"'The Perfect Crime': This tome contains a detailed list of physical and mental training exercises, all of which are designed to condition a person to become the perfect emotionless criminal mastermind.

They also gain a +4 bonus to all skill checks related to criminal activities.","30":"'Killing the Unseen': This tome contains detailed information on killing powerful and hard to find creatures. While most of the book is generally helpful, it is prohibited by all major religious groups because the final chapter goes into detail explaining all the possible ways for a god to be permanently killed.","31":"'Death Eternal': This book was written by an ancient dwarven smith famous for making cursed blades. It describes rituals needed to create blades that trap the souls of those killed by them, with the blades growing in strength as the number of souls trapped within grows.","32":"'The Death of a Nation': This cursed book seems like a perfectly normal political drama, however, if the ruler of a country ever sees this book they will feel compelled to read it.

It has a whole chapter detailing the unique qualities of a newborn's soul.","35":"'The Endless Litany': Every single page of this thick tome is filled with the same phrase repeated over and over again 'The end is never the end is never the end is never the end' but despite this monotony, when a creature starts reading from the first page, they can not stop of their own volition, nor will they ever reach the end no matter how long they spend reading it as the book has an infinite number of pages.","36":"'The Hedge Witch's Pestle: Being a Treatise on the Peculiar Mischiefs of Hezibiah Chopwits, by Lady Althenea Von Blecher': An annotated spellbook, compiled by an educated lady wizard, cataloging the malevolent magics of an infamous hedge witch.

Each spell is powered through the sacrifice of a bit of the caster's sanity.","37":"'Codex of the Anointed, author unknown': This manuscript is not so much written as tattooed on a thin, fine parchment of undetermined origin. Written in an (as-yet) undecipherable language, it is decorated with images that sometimes squiggle between the lines and sometimes stretch over a two-page spread. The images depict vile scenes of mutilation, murder, and ritual sacrifice. Examining it for more than an hour at a time provokes severe headaches with strange sensory effects, including coronas of burning light, flittering shadows of many-limbed creatures, and the pervasive smell of burning flesh.","38":"Inglenook's Inglebook, by Inglenook': A much-dreaded thing, location presently unknown. It takes the form of a colorful children's picture book, telling the tale of a young child who travels to a beautiful kingdom under a tree-topped hill. Sightings over the last two centuries describe it as appearing unexpectedly in a child's play-room or bookshelf. It seems to change itself slightly for each child who reads it, reflecting that child's particular appearance and interests in its illustrations. Any child under the age of puberty who reads it to the end disappears before the next sunrise, even if well-guarded in a locked and warded room. Any child who starts but does not finish it is haunted by dreams of it their whole life.","39":"'Bargains of the Underworld': A mysterious memoir recording the author's descent into madness after murdering his family and his journey into the plane of the dead to plead their forgiveness. It contains locations of planar portals, and describes ways to communicate with the dead. Its crimson cover is unnaturally cold.","40":"'The Dollmaker': A diary of a woman who's stalking a dollmaker.

As the book goes on, the author stops documenting myths and starts writing about their own theories on how the world came to be. From a flat earth carried by a turtle to everything being a reflection of a true reality, this tome is filled with heretical ideas.","53":"'Dreams': A long single page scroll, made of papyrus and kept in a golden case, introduces the reader to the concept of ascension through meditation and study. The author believed that all of existence is a dream and that the gods are simply individuals that, like lucid dreamers, can manipulate the dream.

Intended to be a manifesto on why magical knowledge should be publicly accessible, but Litwick's detailed accounts make this a how-to-break-out-of-prison guide.","61":"'Der Abenteurer': A highly controversial exploration of power and hierarchy, heavy with economics and philosophy. The book posits that the contemporary societal structure of roving adventurers questing for artifacts, slaying everything in their path, is a degenerate state that perpetuates an unfair system of oppression.

By strictly following the bizarre sequences of meaningless actions and chanting the meandering chapters-long verses, the reader will find themselves on another plane. The technique fails to transport the book itself, stranding the reader unless they've committed the entire text to memory.","64":"'The Assassin's Textbook': A book filled with firsthand accounts of successful high profile assassinations. Each entry places heavy focus on preparation and planning, and was written by the assassin who did the deed. There are numerous blank pages at the end of the book, and a note on the inside cover demands that the reader must write down their own story if they succeed in killing someone, then hide the book in a public location at night. The first several entries were written by the same person using the pen name 'Splattershrike.' It is speculated that Splattershrike collects and reads any used copies of the book and makes new editions of it to include his favorite additions.","65":"'Three Steps to Godhood': This book details an alleged path to apotheosis by performing three tasks. At first glance, only the first section of the book is legible while the middle and ending sections of the book appear to be blank black pages, but a person who completes the first task will be granted the ability to read the second task, and so on. The first task is to build a flesh golem from pieces of people you have murdered in a specific fashion.

The book describes the Domain of Dying Stone and its ruler, the archfey Carraig Bhan. The entire demesne is darkened, and somehow the very earth is beset by what Eoin describes as 'rock rot'. The ground crumbles as you walk, and standing in one place is a death sentence. Lord Bhan eventually died at Eoin's hand, but Eoin left before he looted the living wood castle of Brisa'cloiche. He ends the book with a warning that the Domain of Dying Stone is sealed, and should never be opened lest the rock rot or whatever survivors are left escape. If you have the book, a high enough intelligence or skill check will reveal the location and trick to unsealing the Domain of Dying Stone, should you wish to loot an Archfey's hoard . . .","68":"'The Canted Buried Tails by Chauzer the Wandering Bard': In this tome are a series of fable-esque tales about a dozen or so devils that all lose their tales (and thus their ability to reform and resurrect themselves on death) to various holy men and adventurers, and is full of many memorable characters and clever escapades that Chauzer witnessed while traveling the prime material plane. It's a mostly forgotten book, but scholars have proven that most of the events described actually happened, although no concrete proof of the devil's tails exists. In the text, there are several sections where Chauzer seems to rant about seemingly nonsense or politics or theories or something, but in reality is a cipher that translates to the location of the devil tails, where they are buried, and how to resurrect the devils should you so desire.","69":"'Atlas Drugged by Old Rain': The story is about a conspiracy in a land ravaged by an apocalypse where the land is being reseeded and is a controversial book that most people take to mean as a warning about trusting nature too much cuz she's a fickle bitch. The story is banned because in addition to not being clear about its message it also includes theoretical ideas about how to end vegetation in continent sized swathes.","70":"'Gringus Jabeens by Farleeaeen the Warforged': A book of perfectly metered jibberish, written by a warforged who wanted to prove that language itself is unnecessary, as sound and voice are enough to convey beauty. Supposedly, any voice, including a monotone warforge's voice, that reads this tome aloud unlocks a secret about speech that surpasses language. In reality, Farleeaeen discovered a way to turn any who read his book into sleep agents for his plan to 'civilize' civilization.","71":"'Unhinged by Drahssuss Silsissisius': A book about a Yuan-Ti that was always hungry. At first it seems like a children's book about a silly snake guy who eats too much, but he starts to eat less children friendly things, gets around to pets, then people, and eventually eats an island and then a black hole and becomes a warning about gluttony as well as a mythical monster to unleash, or a treasure hoard within it to loot for untold wealth.","72":"'Shameful Swordplay': How to Fake Being a Martial Archetype with any Style of Magic by The Wizeruidicard (a mage who knew wizardry, sorcerer, druidic magic, clerical spells, and was a bard). In it he describes how to use illusion and trickery to boost AC, mimic physical weapons with magic and magic use, and most importantly: how to win and NOT get caught when using 'magical' techniques. It was banned because the author raised a small army of mages, paraded them into a nearby kingdom and successfully tricked them into thinking they had no mages, and then destroyed and looted the entire metropolis with brutality.","73":"'The Ones That Lives Inside The Walls': A innocent looking book containing a well written story of a man slowly going crazy by reading a book, and starts to think there are monsters with no eyes and fingers like long needles living inside the walls, until he takes his own life to avoid those beings. Who ever read this book slowly went mad thinking that they're persecuted by the same monsters, and if they don't kill themselves, are usually found dead with their body covered in punctures and scratches","74":"'The Nefarious Index': An unfinished but pretty much updated list of apocalyptic prophecies made during history with detailed plans on how to make them come true. It seems like many different evil minds during the time have added to this list, maybe recommending improved ways to destroy the world, or took inspiration from it. It feels like reading a lab report from the most evil people in history for the most nefarious experiments.","75":"'The Void Journal': Bound in a rich ebony cover, this book is full of blank pages. Anything written into the book bleeds into the pages, and becomes forgotten to all.","76":"'The Forbidden Harkness Symphony': this yellowed vellum binding contains the last-known work of acclaimed composer Johan Harkness. Harkness was commissioned by an unknown benefactor to create his masterwork. He fell into a deep despair and locked himself away to work. After months of silence, his sisters had to force their way into his house. They found blots and notes scratched across the walls, and Johan, emaciated and huddling in a corner, trying to carve more Tiny notes into a corner. He was committed to an asylum, dying shortly after. While clearing out his house, the sisters found this binding full of notes, blots, and scribbles. The binding was sold shortly after, though neither sister would remember agreeing to sell it or who bought it. The binding was thought lost for decades until the Duke of North Venacia held a summer gala for 300 guests. Officials later found all attendees and staff in the ballroom dead, torn apart by one another. The binding was left open on the stage. Opening or reading the book has no effect, but playing any of the music causes madness for everyone in range.","77":"'Roumerol and Julle'ta': The tragic story about the love between a Mind Flayer and a Githyanki set during the gith uprising. It's banned by the githyanki for its humanizing depiction of lithids and by everyone else, for its explicit 'love' scenes.","78":"'The Ballad of the Laughing King': Similar to Dreams, This nihilistic tome is the personal account of an eccentric former adventurer calling themselves the Ebon Jester. Other than this book, there is no record of him existing. The book claims that the world and all those within it are simply constructs formed from the thought of a single all-powerful individual: the Laughing King. In the final chapters it alludes to the possibility of several creatures who may be free of the King’s direct influence, and the descriptions given eerily match the descriptions of the party’s PCs. The Laughing King is you, the GM.","79":"'Loving Return': Written by Pepeq Gufgord, a necromancer of some renown. This book is pale green with black lettering and an embossed cartoonish skull in the center of the cover. Inside this book is a tale in the style of a children's story about losing a loved one and how to bring them back from beyond the grave. Disturbingly the book gives a fully functional process of ritually summoning an undead with such ease that a child may perform it with little difficulty.","80":"'The Origin of': Seemingly an unfinished book by an unnamed author. It is written as a journal that describes the author's thoughts, steps and achievements to create souls out of thin air. While they seem to be magical capable, the methods described later in the book would even make a non-magical adept person able to create souls. While the author seemed to be able to create individual souls in waste quantities, binding them to simple objects and even complex dolls or golems, do these souls seem to decay rather quickly. On the last pages of the journal the author describes methods to bind these souls to flesh. The results of these methods are missing.","81":"'Moving Stars': Written by Thinia Egotis, astronomer. Her detailed descriptions of real stars - not planets - that seem to move in various and random ways, with written and drawn details, seem to be a lifelong collection of astronomical observations. While the book is mostly filled with entries of those stars, the end of the book is an analysis of those movements with a detailed theory that these movements are not random, but ways of communication. Just not with us involved. it is banned because of some of the 'results' this book contains to decipher this celestial communications.","82":"'Omnigas': This book seems to contain any other book ever written, magical or non-magical. Opening the book means to open a random book on a random page. While open this book is an identical copy of the random book, from beginning to end, with the same effects of the original book. Only the book cover stays the same. Also, there is no way to control which book it contains next.","83":"'Compendium of Unreality': This book in cover that depicts constellations is a weird one. On each page's corner there is an Elder Seal. Letters and illustrations emanate otherworldly light and dance before readers eyes, trying to share more secrets of the Far Realm than they should. Studying the book allows the reader to gain basic information on any aberrations, Great Old Ones, nature of the Far Realms (which is unimaginable, but makes sense, when you tilt your logic a bit to the left). Studying the book for 1d8 hours allows to gain basic theory of psionics and Far Realm magic, or detailed knowledge of specific aberration or Great Old One and requires a Wisdom Saving Throw (DC 20), on failure you gain one short term madness. Studying the book for 1d8 days allows to gain knowledge about a single forbidden ritual, knowledge on how to gain connection to a Great Old One and character gains one indefinite madness.","84":"'The Interviewer's Handbook (Unabridged Edition)': A manual for government officials tapped to act as judges and prosecutors, the version most receive is highly redacted, only containing the first 5 chapters and stripping out most of the text, and even then Chapter 5 can only be described as a torture manual. The original, written by a then-famous judge as their final work, is 10 chapters and three times longer. Chapters 6-10 describe progressively more atrocious means of finding the truth of a case, up to and including rites for negotiating with extra-planar entities and interrogating the souls of the unwilling dead. Most damningly, it is not just a manual on how to do these things, but an expertly written treatise on why doing these things is necessary; anyone reading this book through to completion shifts alignment towards Lawful Evil.","85":"'The Journal of the Arch-Paladin': The logbook of a very famous paladin of a major faith, copies of this journal are kept under extreme security and only shown to the most trusted acolytes of the faith. The titular Arch-Paladin was one of the most accomplished monster hunters in the land, and their recorded notes are one of the finest primary sources on how to identify and terminate things that go bump in the night. But the writer suffered an extreme crisis of faith less than halfway through their career; they never lost the drive to protect the innocent, but they did lose their faith in their god. Maintaining the pretext of serving the church so they could continue their work, the evidence of their crisis and eventual abandonment of their faith is written all over the pages. Any paladin or cleric of the same faith who reads this book in unredacted form is in danger of either losing their faith or turning oathbreaker/blackguard.","86":"'The Traitor's Recipe Book, Annotated Edition (aka the Redline Edition)': Originally part of a cunning ploy by a king to root out a conspiracy in the academic community, the Recipe Book was created as bait for would be rebels and usurpers, full of what looks like legitimate instructions for an insurrection. Anyone found owning or copying the Book was arrested, and anyone trying to use the instructions inside was in more danger of killing themselves than anyone else; all the ciphers were already cracked, directions for making explosives and poisons included the wrong ratios and missed critical safety precautions, and so on. But someone who knows what they were doing got their hands on a copy, and went through it with a red pen and an eye for mayhem. Anyone reading out of the red-lined copy has everything they need to be a king's worst nightmare. Speculation abounds about the hand holding the red pen; anyone caught with a Redline copy is tortured merciless in an attempt to find a clue to the editor's identity.","87":"'To Behold a Dream': On its face, the book is a manual on improving one's quality of sleep, with instructions for ways to construct finer bedding out of commonly available materials, how to heat/ventilate a sleeping area for maximum comfort, ways to improve quality of sleep in rough/field conditions and meditations to ease the transition to sleep. If followed, practitioners have an easier time getting to sleep, suffer fewer penalties if sleep is interrupted... and have dreams which would be disturbing to an outside observer, but strike them as normal. Dreams of ever growing malice towards mankind, which grow more detailed, more specific, until eventually the practitioner dreams a Beholder into existence, which typically kills the dreamer first before moving on to a life of destruction and chaos.","88":"'The Tome of Fiends': an ancient tome written by the now dead god Creator of the fiends. It contains the real name of every Demon Lord and Archdevil that exists, allowing its owner to summon them. All of them are bound to obey by the power of the tome. Thus making its owner the Lord of Fiends. Its language can only be understood by archfeys, celestial, demon lords and archdevils, and each faction has been fighting over it for centuries as gaining control of all fiends, even for fiends themselves, is a huge power. Fortunately it has stayed on the Material Plane and has always belonged to a mortal guardian.","89":"'How to Butcher A Child': A small pocket sized book bound in black velvet. The short manual describes effective butchery methods of a human child, with grotesquely life-like illustrations. Several copies of the book have been found, disturbingly each one has its own illustrations unique to other copies.","90":"'Le Petit Livre Du Calm': A tiny book in an unknown, likely fictitious language that one noble who came into possession of it spent their entire fortune trying to discern the contents and origin of but to no success. The book was seized from the nobles estate once they became bankrupt as the local authorities deemed it to be 'A source of derangement and fanaticism'. Seems untranslatable even through magic. Printed on the yellow cover is an image of a cloud.","91":"'The Child's Adventure, by Mama Micopolis': When read by an adult, the book is a sweet adventure about a child going on a magical journey. When read by a child, they are encouraged by the book to go into dangerous areas or to fight dangerous monsters. The book detail's their successes. Reality is rarely so kind. The main character is always that of the child, or a child of similar look.","92":"'The Cursed Play, or the Tale of the Seven Songbirds': A wonderful play about seven women who were transformed into horrid beasts, but rescued a dashing hero. If the play is performed, and a single detail is off, then the play begins to mess with the reality of the theater. This typically results in several injuries, as well as a few casualties or fates worse than death. The more errors, the stranger the play gets.","93":"'Humanity's Right': A book which encourages family life, good living, and the extermination of all sentient beings. Aside from humans. It's not magical, but areas where it's printed typically find an increase in non-human racism. (Every race seems to have at least one book of a similar nature, typically written by some bored noble or an artist who got rejected from art school).","94":"'The Torturer's Apprentice - Vol I: Humans': A practitioner's guide to inflicting pain on humans. Techniques and discussions on torture-based interrogations with illustrated guide to equipment and anatomy. Volume II to IX vary by location. Copies are usually stained.","95":"'The Oneness': Appearing to be written as a treatise on achieving one-ness with the universe, it is in fact a grim joke by a jealous god. Following the meditation path in the book by 'clearing the mind' leads to the person eradicating all conscious thought. Permanently.","96":"'Vile!': A scrawled, angry diatribe against a seemingly innocuous merchant named Ko'yu Curfdee. This cursed journal slowly corrupts the reader to find every day, ordinary occurrences as disgusting and repulsive.","97":"'The Infinite Diary': A mysterious diary that never runs out of blank pages, and compels its current owner to write everything they do each day of their life from the day they come across the book and up until their very last moments. The identities of the people whose lives are recorded in the diary, as well as whether any of their diary entries contains any information relevant to the player characters, is entirely up to the DM's discretion. Also, strangely enough, the book already comes with the name of the player character who has picked it up written on the index, almost as if it somehow knew they'd be its next owner...","98":"'Food for the Soul': A book that explains how to harvest the souls of recently deceased creatures and use them as raw ingredients for cooking food. According to the book, eating a whole dish infused with a creature's soul allows you to peer into its memories, but at the risk of having your body temporarily taken over by the restless soul, who will attempt to act the same way they would if they were alive for 1d4 hours before passing on to the afterlife and returning control of your body back to you.","99":"'The Dark Secrets of Tarokka': A lengthy treaty written by a very hands-on researcher about the occult origins and uses of tarokka decks. It details the many cults and sects the author infiltrated over time in order to learn about unholy rituals they enacted, and how they used the cards in order to commune with dark forces and gain their favor. As the book goes on, the author slowly begins to piece together bits of information that apparently lead to something truly horrific, and right as he's about to detail the last piece of the puzzle that he had just found, his writing turns into unintelligible ramblings. The afterword found right after that is a dire warning to all those who dare to try and follow in the author's footsteps, and is allegedly signed by an archdemon, ancient one or some other kind of sufficiently powerful embodiment of evil and/or chaos.","100":"'The Halfling in the Sun': The third book in a very popular series by author Vel'ethan Moore. Unbeknownst to the public, Vel'ethan was a powerful warlock who'd spent centuries capturing changeling souls and binding twenty each into the eighth page of the first edition. He'd sent them on a cart to nobles throughout the land, intent on creating a massive empire, but the cart was robbed and the books lost. Many people enjoyed the second edition but tales began to spread of the copies that would imprison your soul and switch it with an evil version of yourself. In response, Vel'ethan was killed and all copies that are found are burnt. Collectors will spend thousands of gold to acquire them. The cursed copies remain, however, and no difference can be found between the editions - until the eighth page..."}},"Dead Men's Treasure":{"type":"Magic Item","results":{"1":"Savoury Salami: Satisfy hunger.

The powder tastes like burnt ozone, which makes it evident that it needs to be snorted. Use causes bonuses to IQ based tasks but also makes its user seek it out more and more for increasingly trivial tasks.","3":"Halfling Weed: Most often dried, chopped, and smoked. Causes extreme emotions to abate and induces near euphoric mellow-ness and, occasionally, a user will experience mild hallucinations. Side effects include increased appetite and red, puffy eyes.","4":"Blue sand: A substance similar to fine sand found at the beach, only that it’s deep blue colored. Consumed through the nose. One to five doses (depending on Wis or Con modifier) are enough to develop an addiction. Early effects (one to three weeks): Enhanced perception, athletics & acrobatics Following deterioration of body and mind: First (after four weeks of constant consumption): One exhaustion stack per three days without a dose. Second (after six weeks): Negative modifiers (-2) on all attributes and disadvantage on all skills. Third (after 8 weeks): Death.","5":"Dream Flake: Thin slivers of a dried, black fungus. When place between cheek and gum, it induces hallucinations and euphoria. When smoked, the user enters an extremely vivid waking dream, which can last for hours. Extended use blackens the teeth and make 'bad trips' more common. Addictive.","6":"Wrymwood: looks like a cinnamon stick but smells of fungus. Grind some up and put in a tea. When drunk, it provides a psychedelic trip for 1d4 hours (halved on a DC 15 con ST and doubled when failing by more than 5).","7":"Grellsvice: A drug usually administered as an oral capsule made from the spikes at the end of a grell’s tentacles. Effects last for roughly two hours on a regular 200 mg dose, and leave the user with a four-hour hangover of sorts. The main draw to grellsvice is a tingling sense in the muscles and extra-sensitive motor functionality. This comes with a strong euphoric rush whenever a new body part is moved. The drawback is the lack of motor functionality during the hangover and the incredibly dulled sense of touch accompanied with it.","8":"Sundrop: a bright yellow/orange liquid, naturally incandescent, as if it was a liquefied ray of sunshine (henceforth the name). Originally used as a magically synthesized antidepressant, Sundrop when consumed tricks the user into believing that they are happy, as it quite literally gives them ‘warm feelings’. Over usage may leave the user feeling withered between uses, as their dependency has rendered them unable to produce dopamine and serotonin. Over time users also commonly begin to build tolerances to Sundrop, requiring greater quantities to be consumed to maintain the effect. Overdosing on Sundrop causes feverish conditions, as the drug radiates through the users veins, ultimately burning them alive from the inside out.","9":"Patch: It works similarly to ecstasy, expanding yourself to feel the sensations all around you. It grants the ability to speak with plants and animals for 1d4+1 hours, and the comedown has a DC15 CON save. Failing the save adds one point of exhaustion immediately after waking from the first long rest you take, and lasts until completing the next long rest.","10":"Lakua: ground silvery bark from a type of tree only found deep in swamps. Low dosages are generally taken orally. Heavier users often make a paste to apply to their gums. Addicts may smear it into cuts. It gives an adrenaline rush and time seems to slow down but the duration of the high is short. Death comes from heart failure or self-neglect. Psychologically addictive not physically.","11":"Zooterran: Made from refined Exem plums. Alters one's sense of direction and causes one to only turn right when faced with a left/right choice.","12":"Blackroot: This lichen grows on large rocks and boulders found above timberline (the elevation at which trees do not have enough oxygen to grow). When chewed on, it causes the user to have a pleasant, tingling sensation of the lips, tongue, and gums. As well, it can give the user a sense of mental sharpness and alertness. If swallowed, it causes nausea and vomiting if the user fails a DC 13 Constitution check. If used for 1d6 hours continuously, the user must make a DC 15 Constitution check. If failed, they experience nausea, but if passed they gain advantage on Perception checks for the next 1d4 hours. Not inherently addictive, though if used for 1d12 days in a row, the user will feel extremely groggy if they do not use it every morning.","13":"Deluge: Packaged in single-dose vials, ingesting this ethereal blue liquid gives subjects temporary access to spell-like abilities of varying degrees; usually cantrips and 1st Level spells, but sometimes more powerful spells depending on the purity of the substance. However, the temporary magic abilities come with a price: each time an individual ingests Deluge they take Constitution damage: 1d4 for average doses, 1d6 and above for purer doses. This is because the magical energy that Deluge is providing is actually taken from their own souls and continued use will cause them to gradually wither away. It’s named Deluge because it feels like a flood of energy and power washes over you.","14":"Barb: A thorny stalk from the Cheb barb weed (looks like purple buck thorn). Sold by the branch, you can pull off individual thorns and use them to scrape or pierce the skin. The side effects are similar to pot, but too much can result in paralysis.","15":"Scurva: a vial filled with an irridesant liquid. When drunk it causes it user to see colors more vibrantly and lights to shimmer and become more liquid like. Also makes its user completely intoxicated.","16":"Fizz: A bubbly, sweet drink in a glass bottle. It has a red label, which reads 'Fizz-Cola'. When you drink a Fizz-Cola, you have the urge to drink another. That's it.","17":"Espiritu: a drug derived from a certain flower commonly used in holy rituals. When blessed, left to wither for at least three days, and then dehydrated completely and turned into a powder becomes a strange blessing all it's own. If smoked or snorted, this powder grants a single question answered by a Divine being. It also grants a strong feeling of peace and euphoria, as well as a strong sense of hunger.","18":"Devil's Root: A black root that is ground up and snorted. The user blacks out and sees visions of hell. Sometimes, these visions allow the user to see into the future.","19":"Wandercaps: When you ingest these plain gray mushrooms, you fall into a deep trance. You experience vivid hallucinations, often nonsensical, but sometimes hinting about the events in the near future. The comedown is unpleasant.","20":"Ember Berries: These faintly glowing black berries are used in coming-of-age rituals in a certain druidic sect. Drink a tea made from these, and you will become relaxed and calm. After a few minutes, flames begin cloaking your body - as long as you remain focused and calm, they cannot hurt you.","21":"Bane: a mix of grinded wild herbs. Primarily consumed by smoking, it calms down the body to a point where you are so apathetic that even your greatest fears won't shock you anymore. Often used as medicine by insomniacs or lunatics, but also object to drug abuse.","22":"Sutara: When applied to the tongue, the user can speak any language they desire, that is, if they can handle the drug. Incorrect dosage or an unprepared system will result in them speaking in absolute gibberish for the duration.","23":"Sharpsugar: Expensive, indulged in by many performers to give them the boost of energy. Removes one level of exhaustion, gives advantage on perception checks, and adds 5 to your movement speed. User becomes jittery. Either snorted or smoked from a pipe. Made out of a rare plant that grows only on the Southern Coasts. The gangs that import it are incredibly dangerous.","24":"Sleepysalt: Similar to sharpsugar, but with different effects. +5 temporary HP and resistance to bludgeoning damage for 1 hour. At the end of the hour, you fall asleep for another hour.","25":"Drakeroot: Concentrated nectar of the mandrake plant. When you drink it, you go into a coma for 2 hours. During this coma, your outer layer of skin becomes more like a cocoon. At the end, you emerge with all health point fully restored and any scars gone. After 24 hours without another dose, you cannot heal using your hit die or over a long rest without using more Drakeroot. This continues until you break the addiction.","26":"Sannish: A blue liquid distilled from the milk of wolves and a powdered desert plant. Causes euphoria and gives advantage on constitution saving throws. Very cheap, but also quite addictive. After three uses, your lips seem to be stained blue and cannot be washed off without magic like prestidigitation.","27":"Mordayn Vapor: Also known as Dream Mist. Made from the ground leaves of a rare herb found deep in the jungle. Taken by dipping in hot water and inhaling the vapor from the tea. The raw powder and the tea are both very potent poisons. Inhaling the vapor causes intense hallucinations (albeit happy and beautiful ones). Drinking the tea or eating the powder causes 7d10 poison damage and 2d10 psychic damage. It is very illegal in every region of the world.","28":"Cyclops Tear: Taken by eating the powder. Causes your eyes to water a ludicrous amount. The tears produced are the main attraction of this drug. They taste perfect and are guaranteed to be the best thing you have and ever will taste, but the taste varies by the person. It also only tastes that way to the person whose tears it actually is. To everyone else it tastes like tears. Overdose causes one of your eyes to desiccate and fall out. Oddly enough, people with only one eye anyway are immune to this effect, so it is very popular among Cyclopes.","29":"Goji Leaves: Originally created as a weapon of war, Goji Leaves (when taken in just about any form) give you resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, advantage on all strength checks and saving throws, and rage damage equal to a barbarian of your level. User doesn't become angry though, instead becoming far more confident than they could have ever been without it, nearly crossing the line into cocky.","30":"Zaegoo: Harvested from a breed of gelatinous cube native to the colder regions, it causes a biting cold sensation on the way down, but gives you immunity to cold damage and the ability to withstand cold climates for 3 hours.","31":"Terran Brandy: A brandy made out of the essence of dying fey. Gives +2 intelligence and restores 6 spell slots worth of slots (so either 6 1st levels, 1 6th level, etc.). May or may not invoke the wrath of an archfey. Only used by the most rich and powerful (and evil) archmages","32":"Luhix: Made from the powdered stalks of a plant grown in the Abyss by demon lords to give to brainwashed cultists. Applied to an open wound that is then sealed with either bandages or magic. User has intense pain for the first minute, with -1 to all ability scores. Afterwards, user is immune to pain (they still take damage, but it doesn't bother them) and they have +2 to all ability scores for 10 minutes.","33":"Agony: The distilled essence of pain. Mainly used by torturers as a social lubricant, but masochists will sometimes also seek it out. When the thick, reddish-brown liquid is ingested (via mouth), the user is hit by intense pain, making them unable to move for 2 rounds, having disadvantage on all ability checks for 1d6+1 minutes. During this time, target will likely give up any info. After the pain, user feels intense pleasure for 1d4 hours, although this is less an effect of Agony and more of them appreciating their lack of pain.","34":"Yggdrasil Sap: A legendary drug that causes you to see into your future. This future is usually the users own death if they don't pass the DC 15 Constitution saving throw to not die from it.","35":"Weirdling Tea: a tea that shifts in color from orange to blue, when drank the user sees the effect of a roll on the wild magic table. (This is however just a hallucination)","36":"Tasha's: a powdered form of Tasha's Hideous Laughter, looks like a great time, but really isn't.","37":"Powdered Power: a glittering substance that almost looks like diamond dust, consumed by snorting. It fills you with a sense of euphoria and you feel like you can do anything, for about an hour. During this time you have advantage on all ability checks and attack rolls. After the hour is up, you must make a DC 5 CON save against addiction, and the DC increases by 5 after every dose. Should you fail this save, you then have disadvantage on all ability checks, saving throws and attack rolls until your next dose. Once addicted you no longer have to make CON saves after each dose. To remove the addiction you can make a DC 20 CON save after going one month without taking a dose.","38":"Brighteye Venom: This venom has, so far, only been consumable by having the Brighteye Spider inject the user. The bite leaves small, purplish holes and blue lines run up the veins. The user’s eyes will turn purple and blue, as if the cosmos were trapped within them. A creature injected with Brighteye Venom must pass a DC 16 Constitution save. Failure results in the creature being stunned for 1d4 hours and poisoned for 1d4 days. Passing the save allows the creature to cast the scrying spell, with a spell save DC for the target of 20.","39":"Top hat: a small top hat shaped consumable that melts on your tongue, soon enough you begin to see statistics on item weight, size, price, juice content, fuzzability, gloppiness...and perhaps some or all of these are just made up in you mind.","40":"Druidic Dream: A mostly benign pill made by druids and sold to whoever wishes to buy some. Its ingredients and manufacture are secrets the druids keep to themselves. When held under the tongue the pill puts the user in a mild state of giddyness similar to being a 'happy drunk' for 1d4 hours (DC13 con save for half, 19 to deny), followed by 1d4 hours of sleep with idyllic dreams. Addiction 1, 10%, nature.","41":"Elendran Pipeweed: Algae that were considered a pest by the Elendran merfolk, until some crazy surfacer decided to set it on fire and noticed his mind was both sharper and duller at the same time. Gives the user -4 intelligence and +2 wisdom while smoking it, though it takes a minute to kick in and a minute to wear off once the user stops. Acquisition: 20gp for 5 minutes worth of weed. Addiction 1, 5%, nature.","42":"Feywillow Fruit: Fruit from a tree in the Feywild. The more the user eats, the more they want to eat. It is not harmful in and of itself, just highly addictive. Heavy users are eventually drawn into the Feywild, leaving their friends and families behind, often without saying a word. Addiction 2, nature.","43":"Funpowder: A magic/alchemic powder made by reclusive druids, funpowder changes the user's biologic gender for 1 hour for every ounce consumed. Usually consumed while diluted in water and/or in combination with a spiked drink.","44":"Mountain Lotus Extract: A rare but enormous mountain lotus is put in a cauldron filled with alcohol and sugar. The cauldron is then heated until the flower dissolves, then left in the fire until most of the alcohol evaporates and a black sludge is left. The sludge is then mixed with Chemis sawdust, at which point it can be either eaten (either by itself or as a spice) or smoked. When used the Extract greatly expands the user's mind, granting +6 to intelligence, wisdom and charisma for an hour. Once the effect wears off the user must make a DC30 intelligence saving throw or 'gain' a permanent -1 to intelligence, wisdom and charisma, as their brain has overexerted itself. This effect can only be removed by a Wish spell.","45":"Stardust: This dust is harvested by aliens and eldritch space horrors from dead stars and from the wake of meteors. It is generally consumed by mixing it with water or some other beverage, and it tastes sweeter than sugar. Other than mild dependency, users have a tendency to gradually turn into eldritch horrors with long-term exposition to the drug. Addiction 1, 50%, planar.","46":"Purified Stardust: The raw dust is harvested by aliens and eldritch space horrors from dead stars and from the wake of meteors. An archfey then purifies the stardust, keeping its ability to provide visions while lowering the addiction. It is generally consumed by mixing it with water or some other beverage, and it tastes sweeter than sugar. The user sees through illusions and shape shifters, but also hallucinates to the point of being unable to tell truth from reality. Addiction 1, 20%, nature.","47":"Styxroot: A root that grows on the margins of the river Styx in the Seven Hells. Eating it raw or making tea out of it makes the individual unable to remember anything that happens to them for the next 8 hours. A constitution saving throw of 12 lowers it to 6 hours, 15 to 4 hours, 18 to 1 hour, or 20 to completely ignore the effect.","48":"The Flayed Mind: A drink containing some of the Mind Flayer's mind-numbing powers. Makes the user dumb and slow, much like weed however much stronger. Any mental saving throws made while under its effect automatically fail, making this the preferred tool of enslavers everywhere. Once the effect wears off the user may make a DC20 int save to remember what happened while under the Flayed Mind's effects. This saving throw can only be made once. Addiction 1, psionic.","49":"The Ladies' Love: Succubus sweat has pheromones meant to make men go crazy in bed. Some alchemists can potentialize this effect, making it stronger and longer lasting. When this paste is applied to the skin it removes all inhibitions from the user, as well as making them more selfish and straightforward. On males it causes them to become aroused and extra horny, while mildly improving their physical skills (+3 to str, dex and con). All effects last an hour. DC 16 charisma save denies. Addiction 1, demonic.","50":"Underdrink: A strong alcoholic beverage created by the Duergar, Underdrink consists of several poisonous herbs and monster venoms, all mixed and distilled in a ceremonial fashion. Drinking a full cup is often lethal to those without poison resistance (2d8 poison damage, DC18 con save for half), however those who do not die quickly become dependent on the drink. Addiction 3, alchemical.","51":"Vladri: Arguably the strongest drug made in the Material Plane, vladri consists of Underdark mushrooms dissolved in spider venom. It is sold by the Drow. When injected it causes euphoria and visions of eldritch horrors which may or may not be hallucinations. Lasts 1d4-1 (minimum of 1) hours. At the end of the duration, the target has a fulminating heart attack and dies (DC25 con save reduces it to 10d8 necrotic damage). It is used as a lethal injection, in order to cause a (physically) painless death. When drunk in small amounts it merely causes euphoria and hallucinations for 2d6 hours (DC20 con save for half), without putting your mind in direct contact with eldritch horrors or bursting the heart.","52":"Angel's Trumpet: A plant with immeasurable potency. When the plant is burned and inhaled, you see dead relatives, friends, or others that died nearby and converse with them casually without being phased by their presence. This effect lingers within the body and goes in and out of dormancy every 1d12 hours and lasts 1d6 hours. For potency roll 1d10 for the amount of instances. Roll 1d12 after each instance to determine when it returns.","53":"Mushroom Love: Made from the spoors of Myconids it gives those that inhale its vapors a feeling of connection and is highly addictive.","54":"Cave Fisher Blood Ale: Often drank by Dwarven Berserkers from a killed cave fisher, many simply drink the blood straight and use it's powerful intoxicating abilities to boost battle potency at a price. After drinking, it’s effects last for 1d4 hours. During this time the drinker gains a +5 to melee attack and damage rolls, advantage on Constitution saves, and advantage on saves against being charmed and frightened. However, once the time is up the drinker must succeed a DC 15 Constitution Saving Throw or gain a level of exhaustion. If the save fails by 5 or more, the drinker gains 2 levels. (The advantage on CON saves can’t help on this save because the effect is already over)","55":"Kana Dust: a powder blended from a medical herb and crystalline magic. Gives mages a power boost for their spells. However, side effects increase risk of magic going wild. Reroll 1s on magic damage. Also roll 2d20. Of either are a 1-2 roll on wild magic.","56":"Gorgon: Mushrooms, which are eaten raw or dried and powdered. Gorgon gives the user paralysis for a couple of hours and gives vivid hallucinations, which are somewhat controlled by the user like a lucid dream. Most of the time the experience is pleasant but people have been known to have some horrible trips. Most people will prepare before taking the drug and lie in bed or in a grassy field, but those with more desperate addictions can often been found collapsed in the streets, stone still except for rapid eye movement.","57":"Dreamer’s Fancy: A dark, shimmering liquid extracted from a rare root. When imbibed, renders the drinker unconscious as it plunges their mind into a black void in which they have full control to shape and create whatever they wish. Those who drink from the same root can participate in this lucid dream together, and their creation can be returned to by drinking from this root again.","58":"Flash powder: A vial containing pink vapors and dust. Upon lifting the vial to the characters nose and inhaling deeply, the user will be filled with an immense sense of power and will now be able to run, jump, swim, and lift up to 4 times as much as they previously could for 1 hour. In combat they may take an additional action once per battle. After 1 hour of usage, the user will feel sluggish and will have their senses dulled which will result in a disadvantage on perception and most strength based abilities for 4 hours or until completing a short rest. Each usage of flash powder will get weaker (-1 on the multiplier) for every time you inhale it without taking 2 weeks to recover from your body becoming immune to flash powder.","59":"Limit Remover: A highly expensive pill that after 2 hours of ingesting grants the user the ability to cast any number of spells without restrictions for 10 minutes according to the shady vendor. In actuality it is just a mint, a coat button, or something pull shaped that gives no benefit whatsoever.","60":"Faerie Food: There is a longstanding piece of wisdom, which says that you should never eat food offered to you by a faerie. This is absolutely true; in the Feywild, magic is so commonplace that 'cooking' is considered it's own school of magic, a mix of enchantment and illusion. Such food when eaten provides a taste that is far beyond anything a real tastebud could ever feel, and addiction is fast, difficult to resist and often lethal as mere mortal foods are not even considered food to an addict. Addiction is generally permanent, but can be cured slowly by a specialist who slowly drops the quality of food an addict ears until they can handle mortal foods again. Alternatively, if the food was eaten only once, a well-placed Modify Memory spell may cure the mental dependence.","61":"Faerie Dust: A very fine, iridescent powder, which is kept in a wax, sealed bottle, it is consumed by unsealing the bottle and very gently wafting the contents towards the nose with a DC 10 dexterity check, with failure resulting in an overdose. When correctly dosed, instills a gentle euphoria as senses sharpen and surroundings appear more vibrant, providing advantage on investigation and perception checks for one minute. When overdosed, the user experiences sensory overload, becoming confused for one minute. Faerie Dust, despite the generic name, is actually the collected breath of a faerie dragon. They find it hilarious that mortals can get high off their breath, and will happily provide the breath attack itself with only gentle coaxing. Some faerie dragons make their home in drug dens, exchanging their breath for a luxurious lifestyle and the opportunity to ply their pranks upon the many citizens of a mortal city. Some particularly daring patrons will pay handsomely for a high 'straight from the source', taking the breath attack of the faerie dragonhead on and inhaling deeply. The high provided is incredibly intense, and as a result such services are usually only offered with the recipient strapped down on a specially constructed bench.","62":"Shatter: A waxy, pale amber substance that can be smoked or consumed in a tincture. In lower doses it produces a pleasant high, but in higher doses (and for particularly sensitive individuals) it can cause a person to literally split in into multiple versions of themselves. If a PC consumes shatter and fails a saving throw, they are split into several nearly indistinguishable copies of themselves. A roll of 2 + 1d6 gives the number of shards. Okay, now for the catch: the character's stats must be distributed among the shards with no duplication, so the sum of the shards' abilities is the same as the original character. Additionally, all of the shards have an aspect or condition representing their intoxicated state. After a period of time at GM's discretion, the shards will coalesce and merge again into the original character.","63":"Venge: a deep red powder of mineral origin that can be snorted for a euphoric and stimulant effect. If the character consuming it has any Berserker or Jekyll/Hyde like attributes, their Dark Side will come out 2-3 hours after ingestion, or if provoked. Even characters lacking such vulnerability, become belligerent and disagreeable after doing a line of Venge.","64":"Mummy Powder: though its true origin is unknown, the one thing that's certain is that it doesn't come from a mummy. When a sufficient quantity is consumed mixed with wine, it puts the drinker into a catatonic state for several hours. They experience a sensation of being transported elsewhere, into a vast unlit space. Cold cyclopean stones tile the floor and neither walls nor ceiling can be found. Many experience a presence, a monstrous and unspeakably ancient intellect with only one desire: escape from the dusty emptiness of this prison and into the fullness of the waking world. This being can and will barter various intangible goods: knowledge, memories, skills. However, it only has access to such things as it could previously have acquired from another mummy powder user. Furthermore, it will not give any knowledge directly pertaining to its own nature or the nature of mummy powder. Finally, before making such a transaction, characters are filled with a sense of dread and the knowledge that the being would only have carried out such a bargain if it brought the day of its escape nearer. This can be represented by a will save if the GM wants to emphasize the direness of the act.","65":"Forget Me Nots: These flowers grow in the wild, yellow in color. They can commonly be found in bright sunny climates. When consumed they apply a temporary new life. When consumed you believe you have a different life. If a lone wolf Assassin ate one he could very well believe he is a humble lumberjack with a small family in the countryside, at least for a couple of hours (1D4 hours)","66":"Fever Fire: Made from the petals of a translucent flower that grows even in the coldest and most barren environments. Instantly incapacitates the user and raises their internal temperature to 110 F for one minute. Instantly cures frostbite, but the user must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end or suffer 1 point of exhaustion.","67":"Crit: A street drug, popular with daredevils and dreadnoughts that will make every roll a 50/50 critical fail or critical success for 1d6 hours.","68":"Beholders Tears: A liquid applied to the eyes with a pipette that grants 30ft truesight for 1d4 hours. But also causes hallucinations ('Ok, the Ghost has gone down that corridor by the dancing Bugbear troupe... Remember to give them a tip as we go by’). Roll WIS save DC 20 or gain long-term madness extreme paranoia.","69":"Umber Hulk Brain Brew: A rare thick dark brown drink. After being ingested the user can cast confusion 3 times no spell slots required. But the user also loses their memory of the most recent 1d6 hours.","70":"Reverie Sticks: Thin, hollow sticks similar to those used for incense. When burned, the smoke causes non-hostile creatures to enter a relaxed, dreamlike state. Reverie sticks can also be snapped in half under one's nose; a sharp inhale of its contents delivers a powerful rush of euphoria. The user has advantage on checks to resist fear and disadvantage on checks to resist being charmed for 1d4 hours.","71":"Fate's Hair: a flowering plant with long sinewy fibers much like hair inside the flower. When consumed you feel intense euphoria, and have a type of clairvoyance leading you to the next noteworthy encounter fate has planned for you- ahead of schedule. But, is it accurate or merely a hallucination?","72":"The Barbarian's Secret: An ingested dark red liquid that tastes strangely coppery. Requires a CON save DC 20. On a successful save you gain a great sense of confidence verging on recklessness and advantage on Strength checks for the next 10 min. On a failed save you still gain the features of a successful save but your INT score is reduced to 4 for the next 10 min.","73":"Stone Brew: A mixture containing what seem to be spiced-up brittle rocks. It hardens the skin of whoever drinks it, increasing their base AC by 1 for 1d6 hours. It is not advised to make this drink if you aren't familiar with stones, as the wrong kind will scratch your throat and provide you no benefit.","74":"Shadow gut: A strange slimy slippery pitch-black gel that needs to be ingested. Once used it will give 3d8 necrotic damage but it will also grant a +5 to stealth checks for the next hour as the user appears to fade into darkness.","75":"Redthyme: Also known as hate in a bottle or bone-hurting juice. A thoroughly nasty little potion brewed from a strange red weed, the eyes of a cat, thyme, willow sap, drippings from a cow's liver, and the moss from a human skull. A shot's worth of this will drove anyone into a psychotic, agonizing fugue where they will attack anyone they see. Survivors have described the experience as 'pure hell'. The taste is mild but unpleasant, like blood and lemon juice mixed together, but the flavor is easily masked with alcohol. Useful in assassinations, murders, and general evil.","76":"Red Hive: When smoked you can speak with insects, other effects include reddened vision, euphoria, and a crawling on your skin like bees walking on it.","77":"Troll Dust: mixture of various troll parts. When smoked, you gain resistance to acid for 6hrs and it acts as a powerful aphrodisiac.","78":"Devil's Tongue: while high: everything seems so surreal, your body feels numb in a good way, and everything sounds far away. Things outside of ((1D4+2)*10) ft. are a blur of colors and shapes. --- Effects are like true sight, but they allow the user to see (into / alongside) other worlds, mainly hellish landscapes mangled into ours. --- Either a negative effect or disadvantage on dex checks and hearing based perception checks. Advantage on sight based perception, investigation, and insight checks.","79":"Warmroot: A small orange tinted root that on consumption, warms the body, a feeling very similar to being cozy in bed. All senses are slightly dulled. This was initially used for miners who worked in conditions of extreme cold, but was quickly discovered as highly addictive, warping the user into complete dependence on the drug. 3 Doses begins the addiction, with every week following a -1 being applied to all ability checks, stacks to five. They user does not have these effects for 2 hours after consumption.","80":"Drektheth Powder: Commonly referred as 'Dragon Dust'. A golden powder with the same consistency of flour, the drug is overly bitter. After consumption, it makes the user feel much stronger than before, although no actual physical change takes place. The drug is also known to cause shifts in personality, usually making the user act boastful and haughty while under its effects. Sometimes this change will carry over into soberness as well for 1d8 hours.","81":"Illithidust: A deep purple powder made from residue from the inside of Mind Flayer funerary jars. Once snorted or eaten the powder will temporarily provide limited random psionic powers. Roll 1d4 and the resulting effects lasts 10 minutes. 1. The user can communicate telepathically at a distance of 30ft 2. The user can move objects in a telekinetic fashion as if using mage hand 3. Weapon attacks by the user deal an additional 1d6 psychic damage 4. The user gains resistance to psychic damage after the effects have worn off the user must make a CHA saving throw (DC 18) or take 3 Int score damage until their next long rest.","82":"Snakeroot: A root that can be ground into a hallucinogenic powder. One dose (1/4 root) gives you disadvantage on all perception checks for 5 minutes, adding 5 for each dose beyond that.","83":"Unicorn Wax: Burning this wax-like substance that is found under the tongues of certain unicorns and inhaling the smoke will cause the user to experience hallucinations of a magical, bright, and colorful world for 1d12 hours, and increases wisdom by 1 for 1d6 hours.","84":"Shadowfell Sage: Chewing the pitch black roots of this plant will grant the user a deep sleep for 8 hours, during which they will appear dead to anyone that fails a DC 16 medicine check. Overuse results in the subject's heart rate permanently decreases.","85":"Dwarven fury: When smoked by a dwarf, this sour smelling underground moss renders the dwarf immune to gaining exhaustion for the 2d4 hours, after which they must make a DC 8+(number of hours)+(levels of exhaustion) Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they gain all levels of exhaustion they would have taken during the period. If a non-dwarf attempts to use it, they must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw to gain the effects. Otherwise, they are poisoned for the duration instead.","86":"Salja: extracted from the hair-thin root endings of certain tundra grasses, Salja is a faintly bitter, dun paste. However, any food eaten shortly after or while also ingesting Salja becomes incredibly, irresistibly delicious. The drug itself is non-addictive. Instead, users become addicted to the taste of the food they ate Salja with.","87":"Droon: a potent, dull brown salve absorbed through one's pores, Droon greatly amplifies all sensations experienced by the body part, including proprioception. It can be an exhilarating or miserable experience, depending on how it's used- a drooned-up hand marvels at the softness of silk, but might seize up and develop rashes as the temperature fluctuates. The localized enhanced proprioception can be disorienting for new users as well, but the euphoric sensations it grants are well worth it. Droon is rumored to be the refined toxic extract of a particular tall cactus.","88":"Ceruminal: a sparkling, faintly greenish wax originally sold as a decorative soap. A typical oral dose (about 12 grams) is enough to send an adult human of average weight into a pleasant mental fugue. They're incredibly disoriented during this time, often walking in elliptical loops, and when they eventually come down, all they remember is a sense of buoyancy and pleasant warmth. A rare few feel tiny sharp pounding at the top of their head, or dulled pain throughout their entire body. At lower doses, all it does is help clear sinuses. A dose in excess of twice the normal amount per body weight tends to result in worse experiences during the fugue- downing a whole block of Ceruminal soap often makes one feel like their muscles have sloughed off and were then shredded, all while the user can still feel their muscles.","89":"Pixie's Fire: A rose golden-coloured powder-like substance that, when inhaled through the nose or mouth causes the user to become immune to being charmed or frightened for an hour, they must make a DC 15 con save at the end of the hour or gain 1 level of exhaustion.","90":"Ogre's Breath: A strong smelling drug that was accurately but a little unimaginatively named. Once smoked the user gains plus 4 to strength checks while smoking but must make a DC 20 CON save or their brain and tongue swell giving them -5 to their INT score (Min 4) and an inability to speak clearly and a temper. The effects last while they smoke and 3D6 minutes after.","91":"Watchroot: A simple, unprocessed root commonly used by goblins. You can chew over 3 hours, during which you gain advantage on perception checks, initiative checks, and can't be surprised. The juices can stain the teeth and lips with repeated use, leading to addicts being easily distinguishable thanks to their blood-red teeth and lips.","92":"Dried Schmetterling Fish: The mummified remains of what once must have been a very colorful fish. Sardine sized, and extremely salty. The drying process moves this little guppy from incredibly poisonous to merely dangerously hallucinogenic. When consumed it allows the eater to see and hear into both the ethereal and astral planes, interact with creatures found there, and see invisible or shape-shifted creatures for what they truly are. It also makes the walls melt and the furniture start talking. You are considered under the effects of the “confusion” spell for the full hour these visions last.","93":"Apius Acrimonium: The foot long stinger and venom sack of the monstrous Furori Vespartum (Rage Wasp) occasionally used by quack doctors and pit fighters. When stabbed into the body, an affected creature takes 1d4 piercing damage and 2d4 poison damage. If the target survives, it then flies into an unstoppable rage for 30 minute. This rage works as though the creature were a first level barbarian, except that they cannot choose to end it. Every turn they must make a DC15 Wis save or immediately attack the nearest living thing until it dies. Every round they manage to not attack something, the DC goes up by 1, resetting upon failure. When the rage subsides, the creature immediately takes two levels of exhaustion.","94":"Star Dust: This substance comes from the dust off of the wings of a particular moth. When snorted, effects include: darkvision, insomnia, compulsion to follow or stare at light (disadvantage on all checks made against an opponent who is holding a torch or near a bright light source), and a feeling of weightlessness.","95":"Smorock: In the transitive planes, objects left behind slowly dissolve from existence. The moment before they are snuffed out, a mote of dust can be captured. That mote is Smorock a powerful hallucinatory Narcotic It can be taken: (orally): for 1 hour the world will become much more vivid. They will have advantage on Perception and investigation checks, but disadvantage on Wisdom and Intelligence saves. (Smoked): Constitution save.

(Snorted): The player does not get the effects of the drug but has disadvantage on intelligence checks and Charisma checks for 1 hour. (Shelved): the effects are more intense and the player must make a wisdom save at disadvantage. If failed the Player is in a waking dream for 1 hour and must be led by another party member. On a pass the player gains Arcane Sight for 1 hour.","96":"Dragon's Dandruff: A flaky amber salt traditionally used as seasoning by lizard-folk, with it's signature 'chilli-high' making any party memorable. This magical mineral is intensely spicy, with one unnamed individual unused to the taste describing it as akin to chewing on a hot coal. After the initial sizzle (1d2 radiant damage) a teaspoon of the salt gives the consumer a rushing sensation of joy, increasing Charisma by 1 for an hour. After the salt metabolizes, the soul feels overcome by adrenaline, increasing Strength, Stamina, and Dexterity by 2 for an hour, and they are compelled to do physical tasks. Afterwards, they suffer 1 level of exhaustion. All of these effects do no stack. Undead characters take 1d6 radiant damage for every teaspoon consumed.","97":"Raybark: not actually made from bark at all, but by grounding up the thin strips of brightly colored fungus that grow on the northern side of raywood tree trunks. Raybark strongly amplifies 'strange' external senses when ingested or snorted- the ability to sense magnetic north, to tell when people are watching you (and where they are), to sense the coming of a storm, to read the health of a plant by the movements of its leaves in the wind, to see ultraviolet light, etc. The range of senses amplified and the intensity of amplification vary between users. However, the user's sense of their own body is greatly diminished while under the effects of Raybark, so they might trip over their own feet, swing their arms into their sides while running, or fail to properly clench their fists as their fingers miss each other. Produced and used by a convent of hippie-like pacifists who enjoy feeling more connected to the world around them.","98":"Spiral: a flammable, forest-green liquid sold in small dropper jars, spiral is a fast-acting and addictive oral drug. A user's sinuses and sense of balance are thrown out of whack as the drug begins to take hold, making them very dizzy. It simultaneously acts to dull pain and mute powerful sensory stimuli, giving advantage on any rolls that are dependent on resisting pain, blinding light, massive sounds, terrible stenches, etc. The dizzying effect makes rolls to keep one's feet or dodge harder, however. Spiral can be slowly burnt to produce a relatively large volume of smoke that has a diluted version of its effects. The smoke seems to be lethal to most insects, and those that don't immediately die drift around aimlessly until they do.","99":"Paladin's Placebo: A drug that when taken will satisfy any craving for any other drug the user is addicted to. Created by a former herbalist drug dealer that was coached by a paladin to quit their habit and change their life around. Ironically, the supply of the drug is tightly controlled by the Paladin order.","100":"Powdered Order: A drug made from a Marut's metal body this rare and expensive drug is taken when mixed with liquid and drank. The effects last EXACTLY 5 minutes during this time the user must make a CON save DC 20 every time they knowingly attempt an chaotic act (if they don't know the law then they pass immediately) if they fail they lose the ability to lie and shout their intentions. In the past this drug has been used by lawful evil villains to catch or incriminate their enemies or by lawful good heroes for largely the same reasons."}},"Fantasy Wine":{"type":"Consumable","results":{"1":"Blood Wine","2":"Honeywine","3":"Haraleven White","4":"Dragondew White","5":"Bitterthorn Dry","6":"Blood of the Raven","7":"Feather Wine","8":"Elven Wheat-Wine","9":"Nelf Thalor Crush","10":"Amenathas Red","11":"Hefsari White","12":"Emberberry Dark","13":"Figdale Red","14":"Rosewood Vintage","15":"Delmen Wine","16":"Ellholone Crush","17":"Malorian White","18":"Starglen White","19":"Foxmantle Crush","20":"Theenalion Rose","21":"Berdusk Red","22":"Goblin Wine","23":"Namarie Dark","24":"Khaluma Rose","25":"Ogre Blood","26":"Fog-King’s Mist","27":"Golden Touch","28":"Glowfire Dry","29":"Saluna Wine","30":"Dawnrim Rose","31":"Spiderdark Venom","32":"Surinen Dry","33":"Stoneblood Red","34":"Kana Nalore Nectar","35":"Dragon’s Tears","36":"Deepwine","37":"Wild Spellsap No. 4","38":"Laurie Lantar Champagne","39":"Old Empire No. 3","40":"Manycherry Wine","41":"Gnomish Oil","42":"Demon’s Piss","43":"Ilnelond Rose","44":"Dwarven Tomb","45":"Celestial Wind","46":"Nyalume Nectar","47":"Kea Ennore Crush","48":"Wintermead","49":"Arlgroth Wine","50":"Gorgon Claret","51":"Frost Giant’s Kiss","52":"Tintilar Wine","53":"Frostmind Wine","54":"Elderblossom Rose","55":"Runeshine","56":"Salabelle Shadow","57":"Rootweal","58":"Eastgate Ruby","59":"Nightsky Vintage","60":"Wave Thalor Shadow","61":"Belet Champagne","62":"Moonlit Wine","63":"Diamondfire Vintage","64":"Frostfar Ice Wine","65":"Eshna Tirion Red","66":"Wintervine Wine","67":"Wasebel Wine","68":"Andune Dry","69":"Miruvore","70":"A’vethemar Crush","71":"Ashnerius Rose","72":"Troll’s Blood","73":"Purple Grapemash No. 2","74":"Spellshine Wine","75":"Filfa Alari Nectar","76":"Silranlond Dry","77":"Gardell Red","78":"Assassin Wine","79":"Celestial Wine","80":"King’s Vintage","81":"Aboleth Blood","82":"Nese Belanore Wine","83":"Starqueen Red","84":"Redroot Red","85":"Awakened Wine","86":"Soulsliver Rose","87":"Blue Dragon Dark","88":"Firedrake Red","89":"Stella’s Blessing","90":"Crowberry Wine","91":"Grun'mel's Claret","92":"Daggerdrink Special","93":"Colas Rosato","94":"Sel'bin Dark","95":"Sunshine Sap","96":"O’al Alora Ruby","97":"Dragon’s Breath","98":"Mintmore Nectar","99":"Spellkeep Special","100":"Shadowfel Sap"}},"Gnomish Inventions":{"type":"Item","results":{"1":"The Let-Go: A small, metallic box that is riveted with small bumps. The Let-Go was originally sold in toy and trinket shops as a children’s building toy. They were extremely popular with children and adults alike before being removed from shelves due to delinquents recognizing their pure destructive abilities and utilizing said abilities in pranks that more often than not ended with the trigger-er in horrible pain. When stepped on, these metallic boxes would cause searing pain to shoot up the creature’s leg, even being able to punch through the soles of most common boots.","2":"Irvlin's Icy Earmuffs: Upon speaking the command word, these fluffy, crystal clear earmuffs fire two cones of cold in opposite directions, one from each ear (save DC 15).

Can be thrown farther than a usual projectile as it will glide along the air and hit quite a bit harder. Can be bladed or coupled with combustibles for extra effects. Was made as a children's toy, but it’s upsetting lethality showed it far better suited to combat.","4":"Gimble's Fabulous Spring. A high-tension spring device contained in a compacted platform. Can be activated to provide lift, boost a jump, or even to separate heavy objects, however, should the housing be damaged, the energy released by the uncoiling spring can prove spectacularly lethal. Some less scrupulous gnomes have been known to intentionally compromise Gimble's Springs to create traps.","5":"Pimm's Cup: A drinking vessel of average appearance. Through a series of mechanical switches can be used to mix in liquid and powdered additives contained in the outer shell in careful proportion. Originally intended as a layman-friendly potion mixing device, the cup has also seen use in cocktail crafting and poisoning enemies.","6":"Rocky's Favorite Gizmo: Apparently, a strange collection of pipes, wires and odds and ends, careful manipulation of its many valves and switches can lead to a number of effects, although most common is a gout of flame in a 30-foot radius.","7":"Silver Mechanical Door Opener: If attached to a door frame as a full round action and connected to a door handle on an unlocked door and activated as a free action, the mechanical device weighing 25 lbs. will turn a door handle and/or force a door open in 5 rounds as if it were opened with an ability check (Strength) of 14.

Take 1 fire damage per turn while holding this object.","15":"Weapon Effect - Spiked: These vicious spikes add 1 piercing damage to your weapon!

At the end of each successive turn, a creature can re-attempt the saving throw. The top can only be de-activated by a creature who is not currently affected by it. It requires one bonus action to stop the Tantalizing Top.","25":"Winston Probt's Goggles of the Vision Miraculous: A pair of goggles that allow the viewer to see at great distances. An affect they achieve by using minor transmutation magic to actually change the physical makeup of the wearer's eyes.

Yellow: The blades start spinning. If pulled a second time, they speed up; a third time, they speed up even more; a fourth time, they slow down and eventually stop. Green: A series of small lights running up the pole illuminates; pull it again and they go out. Purple: A flashing light on top of the pole lights up and spins until it is pulled again. Orange: A siren blares. Unlike the other functions, the siren wails as long as the ribbon is pulled; it stops when you let it go. The intention is that the backpack will function like a helicopter. However, it doesn't provide enough lift, even if you're gnome-sized. It's more like a ceiling fan in a backpack, and to that end, it does provide a pleasant cooling breeze. The backpack is powered by lamp oil; one flask will allow it to run for a full minute. (The fuel tank is only large enough to accommodate one flask at a time.) When running, it's quite loud and frequently belches foul-smelling black smoke. If properly employed while falling, the backpack will slow you down enough that you won't take damage, at least until it runs out of fuel (in effect it functions as per a Feather Fall spell). The spinning blades may prove troublesome to foes (and friends) in close combat. Obviously the ribbons are intended to be pulled in the correct order, but given there are no instructions or labels, most likely players will pull the wrong ribbon, which could lead to damaging the mechanism or worse -- for example, if you pull the Blue ribbon before the pole is extended, the blades will pop out, likely skewering whoever is wearing the backpack.","36":"Fireball Flamejet: A reinforced crystalline ball with a hole in one side and a tube protrusion on the other. When a fireball is cast into it, it spurts a jet of flame up to 1,200 feet away that does half the fireball's damage. However, it was only tested with low level casters so more powerful fireballs may cause it to shatter and have the fireball explode in place.","37":"Yuan-ti Finger Trap: If used by one creature: Fail a DC 13 Dex save (or voluntarily fail) to activate the finger trap by holding it between your two index fingers. Then succeed on a DC (20- Int Score) strength check to be able to escape. If another creature is proficient with int saves, they can use the help action to make the DC to escape equal 1. If used by 2 creatures: the enemy must make a DC 13 Dex save against being trapped. To escape, the winner must succeed on a contested Int check against the other creature. Every time you attempt the check and fail, add one more d20 of disadvantage.","38":"Whistle of (1d8, 1: Dragons, 2: Giants, 3: Undead, 4: Fiends, 5: Aberrations, 6: Monstrosities, 7: Fey, 8: Elementals) Summoning: On it it's written in Gnomish: 'Blow to Summon type of creature '. When blown, every creature of that type in a radius of 1 mile will hear the whistle and be bothered by it.","39":"A cup of infinite water. Or at least that was the idea. They just put a small portal to the elemental water plane on the bottom of a regular cup. Unfortunately, they did not think about water pressure, so anytime the (very securely attached lid) is removed, it immediately acts like a power fire hose. Make a strength check to open (the pressure keeps it very tight) and, if opened, make a strength or dexterity check to not go flying uncontrollably. You also have to make a strength check to close it.","40":"Wizzwalds Amazing Cube: This is a light cube made of brass approximately the size of 1/3rd foot by 1/3rd foot by 1/3rd foot. This cube effectively works as a spell magnet, if it is very close to the caster or target or between them, the spells will be redirected and absorbed by the amazing cube. The amazing cube technically has no limits on how many spells it can hold, but every time it absorbs a spell, there is a 10% chance (+ another 10% for every spell after the first it has absorbed) that it will expel ALL of the spells it absorbed in all 6 directions it’s faces are facing. This can lead to some incredibly chaotic results, such as shooting six fireballs out of all of its faces, and then flooding the area around it with water before shooting an eldritch blast at whatever targets are on the correct angles of the cube, or charming 4 separate creatures at once while also issuing a command creature spell making all of them drop their weapons. You can reduce the odds of the cube expelling its spells to 10% if you spend half an hour and expend a spell slot with it. However, any spells it absorbs after this will still add their bonus 10% chance.","41":"Henswallow's Handy-dandy Healing Handcrank: This small metal box has a hand crank with a wooden knob and is designed to be laced onto a belt. Once per day you can use an action to turn the crank as fast as you can. Turning the crank emits the noise of ball bearings rolling in an empty can that can be clearly heard up to 60 feet away and soft, white light begins to escape from the seams of the device. Once the crank has been used, at the end of the user's turn the wearer rolls 4d4. Odd numbers are subtracted from the wearer's hit points and even numbers heal the wearer.","42":"Dodecahedron of Listless Wandering: Once activated this 20-sided sphere 1/3 Khelgars across in size will levitate and move in a random direction at 60ft per round. A creature whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by it, taking 6d6 crushing damage, and triggers a wild magic surge.","43":"Bouncy dynamite: It’s more fun to tinker then mine, but buying metals is a bit expensive. Maybe if we can get the dynamite to where it needs to be faster it will bring prices down. Just light and throw. Or go for the shock detonation version. Detonates in the, hmm, says on the box, an unknown number of hits, each stick is different, have fun discovering how many each need to detonate.","44":"Automatic Fire Starter: Tired of struggling to light your pipe or campfire with your clumsy mechanical piece? This automatic fire started is enchanted to light in proximity to wood, just bring the lighter up to your pipe and Voila, it's on fire. I might not have thought this through, I'll put it away. Oh, shit did I have a book in there? Yep, definitely had a book in there, I'll be right back, have to put out this robe.","45":"The Jumping Spear: A two-handed spear specially made for smaller races with a spring-loaded spearpoint and footplants on the butt. At any point a small creature can jump on the footplants and slam down to cause the spear to explode violently forward with or without its wielder. Whenever a wielder uses this feature, they must make a check to remain holding the spear. However, on a success it does an extra die of damage on a hit, or alternatively propels the wielder up to 15ft into the air and 30ft horizontally. ——— It’s a pogo stick with a spear attached to it essentially.","46":"Landslide Module: 100lb drill attached to a clockwork mechanism with an explosive core. Once activated landslide module borrows into the earth in a random pattern (roll dice for direction?) dealing and taking damage until it explodes. Great for mining, demolition work or guerilla warfare.","47":"Punfky's Flying Machine: A glider made from spider silk. Enchanted to cast gust (a 30-mph wind if my math’s correct) 30 feet behind and under the glider. It... works, in the way everything works. Let's just say it's not the most stable thing in the world.","48":"Gordex's Elevating Slippers, Lesser: The wearer of these rainbow-colored slippers may activate the slippers as a free action once daily. Upon activating these slippers, the wearer is instantly elevated vertically d6 ×10 feet into the air. During the ascent, the wearer may attempt to grab onto a ledge or any object they can reach as a DC 16 dexterity check. If the wearer has not grabbed onto anything at the end of the elevation, they begin plummeting to the ground and take falling damage as normal. Note: There are rumors that Goredex created a greater version of these slippers, but by all accounts, they were destroyed when Goredex impacted a moon.","49":"Nigel’s Knackered Knife: A knife with the properties of the Ice Knife Spell, which will activate... eventually.","50":"Havel’s Handy Hoppers: A bag of caltrops that bounce around like rubber balls once thrown.","51":"Viflicks Incredible Disk: The ultimate Frisbee to keep any sort of beast occupied for hours. Unfortunately, it doesn't actually stop once thrown. Not until it hits something solid like a mountain...","52":"Reginald's Rock Cracker: A magical war pick commissioned by a dwarven mining guild. Has 4 charges that restore every day at dawn. Every time the pick successfully hits, it expends a charge and casts shatter at 2nd level focused on the tip. Earplugs recommend.","53":"Traveler’s Survival Compass: This small metal cylinder shoots out a number of sawblades to harvest firewood from small trees. Subsequently it fires a gout of flames roughly the same direction to create an instant campfire. This handy tool also provides a sleeping solution, by spraying a large volume of quickly expanding foam for bedding, and it ensures safety at night by periodically sounding an alarm and flashing lights for the user to wake up and survey their surroundings. Gnome-corp is not responsible for any accidents involving faulty compasses and/or flammable bedding. The deluxe version comes with extra sawblades, scented flames, flavored bedding and a variety of alarm sounds and lullabies.","54":"Chilla's Speed Sheath: If a blade is put in this sheath, a small tug will make an opening in the sheath and propel it forward making your initial attack much quicker. Good for surprise attack, unless you are not good enough to make the DC 15 Dex saving throw to prevent it from flying out of your hands or getting lodged into your body.","55":"The Boomstick: A large club with an opening on the bottom which is filled with explosives and a trigger on the top to make them go off. Just a shame that the club isn’t always sturdy enough to take the explosion, so its recommended the user wears some armor to protect them from surprise shrapnel. Oh, and make sure you can stand your ground, the recoil is terrible.","56":"The Excessively Thin Hat of Excessive Cool: It keeps the character cool in extreme heat, but if the temperature is any lower than extreme heat, the character starts suffering from extreme cold.","57":"Harry's Heating Gloves: Wearer can wear the gloves to heat up whatever they are holding. If powered on for too long the gloves melt onto the wearer’s hands.","58":"Gilgam's Self-Replicating Rodent Remover: a tiny construct that pursues its designated target and 'removes' it. If multiple targets are detected within its range, it will seek out materials to construct copies of itself. If in the course of locating said materials it finds other targets, then it will add those targets to its list while increasing the number of copies needed to cope with the added number of targets. The off switch is conveniently located on the roof of its mouth.","59":"Hellfire Sphere: A black sphere with a button on it. When the button is pressed, the sphere turns glowing red hot and melts through anything it touches. If not deactivated, it will eventually melt its way through any container holding it, and any surface it is placed on (including the ground). The button, which has to be pressed again to deactivate it, also melts anything it touches.","60":"Wind up Mimic: wind it up and set it down in a room, watch it transform into something inconspicuous. Oh, but make sure not to take your eyes off it or leave the room.","61":"Gloves of Burning: Only function if in contact with the user’s bare skin: on a successful melee unarmed attack wearing the gloves, everything in contact with the gloves takes 2d4 burning damage.","62":"Malputon's Mechanical Mount: a bronze knee-high sphere with a small metal seat and a protruding yoke. Once mounted and started, the sphere wheels along the ground with a speed of 200 feet or quadruple the daily rate of a horse and rider. The seat is poorly stabilized, and the rider must make 10 Dex saving throws (DC 16) for each day of riding, or else fall from the mount and watch as it treadles into the horizon.","63":"Mavis's Instant Malleable Metal: This small metal cylinder has as a plunger on one end that sticks tight to any piece of metal it is placed on. A DC 14 strength check is required to pry the cylinder off. When the command word is spoken, the cylinder casts Heat Metal on the metal it is stuck to until the command word is spoken again, at which point it becomes unstuck and falls off. Invaluable for any blacksmith on the go.","64":"Fizz-Spork's Sustenance Seeder: Wide nozzled rifle with a hose that connects to a large, seed holding backpack. A proprietary mix of seeds are stored in the backpack area, the portions only known to Fizz-spork himself. The user sprays seeds in an open field, in the shape of a pyramid to ensure correct sustenance portions. When done correctly, this will grow a perfect selection of crops, sure to last any village through the winter. Sadly Fizz-spork has been bribed by the local vegetable guilds. So, in reality, it only grows the most bland and rotten of fruits, sure to ruin fruits good name and drive customers to the vegetable guild's market.","65":"Spring-mallet's Mice o' Matic: A helm that is sombrero sized, made of brass and tin, etched to the glories of rodents past. Many wires protrude, sending off yellow sparks when in use. When a user dons this helm, they gain the ability to speak and read any mouse's thoughts in a 100-yard radius. After a few hours of wearing the helm, a user can even start to control the minds of mice. Was designed to be a spying device, as the inventor dreamed of sending mind-controlled mouse spies into her rival's homes. Due to a lack of testing subjects (as of course, mice are the best lab rats, and they already speak mouse), the device merges the mind of the user and mice over time. Prolonged use may lead to the user having a strange desire to make bathroom in wood chips and have strong cravings for cheese.","66":"Radrey Zerz’s Pocket Transport: a four-inch by four-inch by one-inch box that unfolds into a small two wheeled vehicle with a T-shaped handle, propelled by the rider kicking off from one leg. Its base speed is 50ft, but any attempt to ride a distance other than exactly 25 feet requires a Dexterity check DC 18.","67":"The Thunder Muffs: Yellow earmuffs that let you hear what thunder sounds like up close.","68":"The Acid Club: A 5-foot stick with 3 jars of acid attached to the end.","69":"The Fingerpurse: A purse with teeth that closes tightly if it detects that someone has their hands in it. (Coins are meant to be poured out)","70":"magical sparkle torch.

As an added feature, it can launch the rider 30' into the air simply by applying pressure to both stirrups and shouting, clearly, 'Go!' in any of 32 languages. There's always a 50% chance that the language is one understood by the animal. Upon activation the animal takes 30' worth of falling damage. Without external influence, the users will take 30' of falling damage upon impact. Originally employed as a safety device in Whirrleygigs Spinning Hover Conveyance.","76":"The Quick Carver: A large very sharp knife. When the blade meets resistance, it begins to vibrate to aid in cutting. This may allow the knife to cut through harder objects or to cut through more material faster. The strength of this vibration is random though. When a character uses this knife roll a D20 -5 to determine the vibration's DC. The character must roll a Slight of Hand (DEX) save against this DC. On a failed save the character or another nearby creature or object takes 1d6 slashing damage at the DM's discretion.

Dim light becomes normal, non-magic darkness becomes dim. Same issue (but worse) as normal night vision in normal or bright light, causing temporary blindness.","81":"Firecracker: throw it in fire, makes cracking noises and sparks, but then explodes into tiny pieces.","82":"Multitool of Amazement contains various tools like wrench, screwdriver, lighter, pencil, torch fuel, taser, flute, mint dispenser, sleeping gas.

You can see the problems with mixing them up.","83":"Speedy Ice Skates of Quickness: these ice skates triple your speed on ice and gives you control of direction on ice. You can't slow down at all though, but why would you want to.","84":"The Steam Powered Spoon: A spoon that moves in a jack hammer fashion.

The web requires a dexterity save or strength save or all those in its area of effect are grappled. One turn after the web has been deployed, it bursts into flames that fill a ten foot by ten foot by ten-foot cube and last 1d4 rounds. The flames inflict 1d8 fire damage per round and characters are blinded while within the AOE.","86":"The Exploding Can: By using the trigger, you activate the oil in the metal can. It ignites a round later and explodes in another round dealing 2d4 in a 5' radius circle.","87":"The Fire Sword: With the press of a button, a small flame increases size to 4 feet long in a sword shape. The Sword does 2d4 Fire Damage. It has a 10% percent chance of Exploding dealing 2d4 in a 5' radius circle.","88":"Phoenix Flares: A new kind of construct that bursts into flame and soars gracefully upwards and elegantly performs aerial acrobatics. Unfortunately its inability to extinguish itself and a few incidents where they burned entire fleets of ships by setting one ship on fire causing the phoenix flare on that ship to ignite and fly into even more ships has stopped any sensible shipping company from buying them , even when having to buy more flares after every sea monster attack.","89":"Filly Lightfinger’s Marble Dispensing Escape Buckle, whereas the wearer secretly triggers the dispensing mechanism that begins to drop hundreds of small spherical metal beads that confound pursuers (and perhaps sometimes the pursued, but I digress...)","90":"Hare's Legs: boots with straps and springs attached to the bottom.

Built to be mounts for Warforged, they resemble nothing so much as a 6-legged Clydesdale. Unfortunately, their turning or braking power lags behind their charge power. They've wrecked entire buildings, thrown riders off cliffs, and generally can be a nuisance if mishandled.","94":"Eksni’s Pointed Beam: a small, discreet metal cylinder that fits into the palm of a medium sized humanoid’s hand. The button attached to the side exclaims “Press Me!” In Gnomish scrawl. Upon pressing the button, a spark of energy ignited inside the tube and projects a beam of red light where it is pointed. If held while used it is uncomfortably warm to the touch, and some models have been reported to spontaneous combust upon ignition.","95":"Flammenwerfer: large gun held like a flamethrower because it basically is one. Torch holder at the front in front of the nozzle. Smallish oil barrel with a piston head at the top with a heavy rock or something to create pressure. When fired, nozzle opens at the front which allows oil to leave by being squeezed out by the heavy piston slowly moving down the oil barrel. When nozzle closes it stops naturally. The oil sprays out a thin nozzle so it’s not too much and can be set alight by the flaming torch in the torch holder but still enough so that it can travel a few meters while on fire. Prone to having fire go back into the pressurized oil container which ends about as well as you’d expect.","96":"Leibowitz's Returning Key Fob: A key ring and fob that returns to the user at tremendous speed to pelt them with their misplaced keys for 1d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed DEX save. Leibowitz never did dial back the velocity of the returning enchantment.","97":"Lily's Opening Reversal mechanism: While not entirely useful, it’s certainly innovative. A device that when physically operated into any type of door will make it reverse its orientation of opening, if previously you would need to pull the door to open it, you now need to push it and vice versa. It achieves this by twisting the physical structure of the door on its axis, fast and in a violent way so the hinges are on the opposite side of the door arch. When installed the operator must succeed a Reflex save to not get hit by the twisting door or get hit by 1d4/6 blunt damage.","98":"Absinthe Candle: An inventive yet stupid gnome by the name of Dankel found himself in a dark bar. In an attempt to impress his fellow bar patrons by creating a light just with what he could find around said bar, Dankel soaked a rag in absinthe, pushed it halfway into the bottle and lit the half of the rap hanging out. It did create a fairly bright but unfortunately quite unruly flame... ultimately causing him to drop the bottle to the ground, starting an even brighter and more unruly flame! ...that eventually took the whole bar down with it... An unfortunate accident really, but it led to the invention of a rather effective weapon!","99":"Gelfe's Hearty Spike: A mechanical spike that is driven directly into the user's heart. It delivers a proprietary blend of potions directly into the bloodstream through the heart giving the spiked user a heightened sense of awareness (+3 to perception checks) and it also gives the user increased anxiety and an unshakable sense that something bad is about to happen.

The author of the document seems almost too knowing on the subject, almost as if he were there...","87":"'Stories from the Orkholds': A collection of poems written by an orcish adventurer and skald.

Their faces are defiant, hopeful; the background is a sunset plains. It inspires courage to those with clean consciousnesses; and guilt, shame, and a need to come clean to those who don’t. If the owner or gallery manager is there, if asked: explains that a possessed child made this, and then promptly died.","64":"The image depicts all the party’s possessions… including a few that they do not currently have. Some seem organized, others seem strewn about, as if the artist wanted you to think someone was purposefully looking for something. It looks like it takes place in an attic. A successful Perception roll leads a character to look where the artist wants you to look away from: two skulls, and a dull gray key with a note near it. The only words the character can make out are “stay away!”","65":"The image portrays the head of a white male human with slicked back brown hair; he has an unpronounced, barely-there widow’s peak. For all intents and purposes, there is nothing special, nothing that stands out, nothing that isn’t normal about this man; he is too normal. He is smiling, a full-toothed pearly white smile–not a grimace, not a grim grin, not an evil grin, as noted by his cheeks and eyebrows. He is happy. There is a twinkle, non-animated, in his brown eyes. The only other aspect of this picture is the brown carved pipe that this man has in his clenched teeth–it is jutting out at the viewer’s left. It is not smoking, but could seemingly be used for such an activity. If any party member is under the influence–of anything–and views this image, trippy razor rainbows surround the head, hypnotizing the viewer, as they stand and stare slack-jawed at the portrait for the remainder of whatever they’re under the influence of.","66":"The painting is of a normal gathering, feast. It looks like tensions are high though. The painting itself gives off a wierd vibe and you realize after some investigating that it is 10 of the demon Lord’s from 1d100 demon Lord’s at a diner (possibly making an alliance or whatever makes sense in your world)","67":"A fox hunt, only the hunters are all high elves and the hunted are humans and halflings.","68":"A painting that encircles the entire room and is actually dipicting the landscape outside the room with parts named and certain notes about the landscape.","69":"A painting of an optical illusion.

The PCs recognize four of the card players as the greatest villain of the century, but the character on the far right is unfamiliar to the PCs.","71":"This painting looks like it may have once adorned a wall in a very high-class establishment dedicated to the pleasures of the flesh. It depicts many beautiful humans and humanoids in varying states of undress, engaged in activities they deem to be highly enjoyable. On a successful perception check, one of the PCs will recognize a parent as one of the beings portrayed in the image.","72":"A painting within a golden frame depicting 4 small dogs each holding playing cards, with many red and blue circles in the middle of the table where they are seated.","73":"A portrait of a seated gorgon, hands demurely folded in her lap.

It is the daughter of a local lord which disappeared on a night of a full moon some time ago. Rumor has it she fell victim to lycanthropes, which are now hunted viciously by the lords men.

When pulled from the deck, the card is in it's normal, faded state.","70":"A rather large iron pot covered in scratches and scorch marks that can't seem to be taken off. Meals prepared by this pot are always palatable but in need of salt, regardless of whether the recipe called for salt, the consumer's enjoyment of salt, or amount of salt that was used in the cooking. Coincidentally, this effect can be nullified by adding copious amounts of pepper to the pot before serving the meal, in which case the food is always suprisingly delicious.","71":"A small bottle of clear liquid labeled “Knowledge, only use in an emergency”.","72":"A tiny stone carving of a headless halfling.","73":"A key made of glass.","74":"A silver ring with a poem in Druidic on the inside.","75":"A tiny bronze idol of a goblin carrying a knife in both hands and one knife clutched in his teeth.","76":"A simple headband with a clear crystal set in the center of the brow.

If the box's owner unlocks it while reciting a brief prayer, all of the stored objects will reappear, spilling out if necessary.

After 1D4 weeks, or once the total exceeds 1D10 * 1000 GP, the seller will steal everything stored in the boxes and skip town.","73":"The Lute of Destiny - Notes strummed on this black-enameled instrument, strung with muscle fibers from a demon's right arm, are uncannily loud and mildly distorted.

To the party's surprise, it's the real deal; the seller claims they need a lot of money ASAP to make good on a bet.

But I still can’t get anyone to open it for me because they’ll want me to return it or accuse me of theft. Best to just keep it under my bed for now.","52":"My nose itches... can they stop talking already?? This is driving me mad.","53":"Oh, they smell. That's disgusting.

He had to go leave me with the twins.","59":"Why did I have to be the one to be (NPC's name here)? They're so lame. Next time, I want to be a duke or something. Much more exciting life.","60":"These aren't my pants! Why am I wearing someone else's pants?!","61":"Really, does no-one else find Orcish women hotter than all other women. Am I alone on this? I can't be the only one turned on by the tusk's right? Right!?!","62":"I'm sooo tired!

I'll always be a turnip farmer.","64":"Strange. I was sick, then I got better, but my wife got sick soon after. Maybe there's some kind of... tiny little creatures... so small we can't see them... that transmit sickness between people... and common illnesses could be avoided by, say, washing your hands to drown the tiny creatures... let's call them, 'germs'... no, it's ridiculous. I should just get back to farming turnips.","65":"Hmmm. If I could build a spinning device, powered by, say, steam, why not, and attached it to a rod that turned, say, some wheels, and put that together into a machine with room for a person to sit, and maybe, a wheel to steer... ah, too ridiculous. I'll always be a turnip farmer.","66":"If I dropped out of my job and went into farming, I could use my druidic contacts to help cultivate my land, and my discoveries in agriculture to farm the greatest turnips the land has ever seen... no, give it up.

Only old Bark toes, well we called him Bark toes on account of being a druid his real name was Faelwyn (Sounds elvish but he was a Dwarf, damnedest thing really)... but anyway, old Bark toes had buried all our paper! Said it was only proper respect for Father Tree. So we had to hunt down a rabbit, tan the hide, then burn the map into it. Took 3 days, and that map reeked up my pack something fierce!","2":"Hah! That reminds me of a particularly harsh winter when a dwarf I traveled with thought it’d be fun to explore a cave despite us being low on rations. Needless to say by the time spring rolled around I was plus a few Bullywug bites and minus a short bearded friend!","3":"I wouldn’t eat that if I was you.

The hard part was getting the stink o' frog guts off of the gnome.","7":"Things are different these days, they are indeed. I was a Red Arrow, didja know that? Travelled all over these lands, usually in small bands but sometimes they were hundreds of us. Thousands! Everywhere we went we'd work to make people proud of their own accomplishments. Make 'em happy, even if they said our arrows were orange! And if they stole from others, or said unkind things, why we stabbed them with our cold blue spears to let the people know how to behave like proper folk!","8":"This? Just a bit o' mead from home. Like wine, but made of honey; there's a bit of rose in this one, I think. Want a taste? (If offer is accepted, the mead is described as being pleasantly sweet and smooth, if a bit dry. May cause heartburn for those with hearts.) Good stuff, innit? My uncle's favorite; it's basically all he'd drink. We'd usually get that mead with the juniper berries mixed in, but my uncle preferred the rose mead. Said it tasted better. Dunno if I entirely agree, but that's what he would bring over. Heh...I remember one year, he came by, strangely empty-handed. My mum (his sister) asked where the mead was. That's the thing, he said, they said they was out. Some damn fool had made off with the barrels, leaving none for the rest of us. He suffered through the juniper mead, but he sure as hell wasn't happy about it. But then comes next week, right? He comes by with two kegs of the stuff. THEY FOUND IT, he said. He said he'd been walking along when he heard a commotion off the path, went to go check it out. And, sitting on top of a cart, drunk as hell, were the thieves. They hadn't even properly made off with the stuff, they were just sitting there barely off the road. Damn fools. My uncle seemed proud of himself. Man loved his mead. Maybe a little too much...","9":"Hah! That's nothing! You want to know what 'up shit creek without a paddle' really looks like? Lemme tell you a story: Me and four of me mates (or so I thought) were going through the mountains with a big load from... I won't tell, because I might actually get back to that pile o' gold one day. But! We were going through this wicked cave, and suddenly drow, the dark bastards, jump out of the shadows and start shouting at us in broken common. Now, we're alone in the mountains, one weeks travel from any civilization, and ambushed by a crew of drow. That's the shit creek, now where's me paddle gone? Well as if the situation wasn't bad enough, there's a cave in that separates me from me mates (got Spencer's leg too), and now I'm alone against a dozen pissed off drow. Now, how I got out of that situation with only a dirk and a shovel to my name, is a story that there isn't a cup of mead big enough to buy from me.","10":"So there I was, tied up. Not 20 feet from this sorceress and her gaggle of cultists. As the I was cutting my way through my bonds, and trying to signal to my mates that we need to stop this. The cultists were Chanting, the clouds were getting darker and the villager in the middle of the throng was getting really nervous. But all I could think about was that damn sorceress. Anyway, that's how I met my first ex-wife.","11":"That ain't nothin' to be scared of. You ever been chased by an undead thunder lizard, vomiting zombies?

A hundred Sahaugin were storming up the bank, angry as a cat in a pond. We held them back, dropping them 3 to 1. Problem is, that wasn't fast enough and they just kept coming. Well, the Blackstaffs showed up on the wall behind us. Yah ever see what a Fireball does to aquatic flesh? It scared 'em, scared 'em right good but I tell yah, you never smell something so bad as burning water goblin! Except maybe troglodyte...","14":"That's some nice shootin' there. Did I ever tell you about the time I one-shotted an orc with my sling? See, we was jumped on the Trade Way, just a simple escort job. This little warband of orcs jumped us on the road, lookin' for an easy take. Didn't expect we all had steel, yah see? We cut 'em down quick, but one slipped away, with a sack of valuables under his arm. That greenskin nicked an ox, no lie, tryin' to ride it for all its worth. He was bouncing all around and not gettin' too far. I picked up a rock off the ground, loaded my sling, one shot in the back of his head and he went tumblin'; dead before he hit the ground.","15":"That's a fine bit o' gold there.

Mount Hotenow was still having its rumblings and we were pickin' pieces that size out of the rivers!","16":"Oh don't complain about this little drizzle. Did I ever tell you about the time I was sailing back from Chult? Musta been only a couple years ago. We had 3 ships, full of old relics, when a bad squall kicked up. Swells were 30 to 40 feet and rain was crushing down on us in sheets. We barely stayed afloat, and what's worse; Everytime the lightning flashed, we saw tentacles rising up from the depths. Only 2 of our ships made it back... (Looks off distantly, glassy-eyed in memory)","17":"Now that's a fine bit o' cloth. Almost reminds me of Owlbear fur.

Yessir, he was a sight to behold. Fell the whole way down and still managed to get the killing blow off that bow of his. I can't remember how we made it out of that one.","24":"So... you heard of the pale elf Drost Durden and his white tiger? He defied the laws of the over-light mountains, descended from their snowy peaks, and became a hero of the people. But thats just what the stories say, he is probably as cruel as the rest of them. (Note, there is a Dark Elf there listening to this story who looks very... very... very tired at listening to this)","25":"See this scar on my chin? The first deer I ever killed, I must have been 14, no 13. I waited for hours in a tree. Shivering in the cold, hungry as a dog. I pissed myself. Finally a young buck casually strolled up to my tree. I was so cold, I was scared my staccato breathing would scare him off. I raised my bow and my hands were shaking. Luckily it was directly under me. I couldn't miss. I let go and the arrow stuck him good in his side. It jumped up and buck a few times like a roaring bull. Then it hopped around in a a zig zag and almost seemed to lay down for a nap. I was young but I knew to wait a moment before approaching. I slowly climbed down the tree. I slipped the last couple feet. I sauntered over to the deer. I slowly kneeled down beside him. I took a moment to admire the steam coming off his body which some druids believe is the deer's life essence leaving this plane. I leaned in close to his face and I thanked him for his meat which I was about to consume. The deer pulled its head back and butted me right in the face. His antler leaving a deep gouge in my chin. He jumped up took a couple steps and again collapsed under its own weight. At 13 years old, I provided for my family that cold night.","26":"When I was your age, we had no idea that there were any other 'planes'. You were born on the prime material, and that's the way we liked it!","27":"When I was your age, we walked thousands of leagues to dungeons! Uphill both ways!","28":"Let me tell you something, young adventurer. Treat well you're boots for they protect you more than you know. That being said, I will never wear another pair again. I traded my boots for route sandals long ago, and let me tell you, I ain't putting on another pair of boots! I'd rather die! What do you mean I've used the same phrase twice in one sentence?","29":"If you suspect that you're gonna run into gnolls, just piss yourself! Hyenae respect the scent of piss. Makes 'em feel like they're messing with the property of someone powerful, ya know?","30":"I've never been a fan of 'preparing' spells. Back with the clergy of my youth, if you wanted a disease to be cured, THAT'S TOO BAD! YOU HAD TO DIE, JUST AS AMAUNATOR INTENDED!","31":"I never much cared for dwarfs. To stalky. Too hairy. What are gonna do with all that hair, hm? I don't trust it.","32":"Listen well. You need a danger word. I don't care about safe words or what you do with them. A danger word. Some things out there change their shapes. Mimic us. Hide the truth from your eyes. We had a rule. You found a way to work the danger word into conversation if your suspicions were up, but not your patience. 'Eaglepeak'. That was ours. 'Weather here is nothing like Eaglepeak.' or, 'The food here is worse than Eaglepeak.'","33":"One day I wondered off from my caravan to relieve myself in private. Just my luck I was ambushed by bandits at the worst possible moment. Then for the first time in my life I was happy to hear the raspy scream of an owlbear. The bandits all ran in opposite directions, the owlbear had pecked on of them really good and was in the process of turning him into a pincushion with its pointy beak. I pulled my pants up, again at the worst possible moment, and I slowly turned around and walked away, once I got far enough to not hear the pecking of flesh I ran.","34":"There we were, trapped on the bridge between the Harpies and the 4-armed Pirate-Gorillas, when Smendrik the Adequate (as we called him then) got the bright idea to cast Featherfall and Burning Hands through a barrel while we all stood on top! How we got the barrel is another interesting tale, you see it four years prior to then that we came across...","35":"One time we met a Dwarf who bragged that he could disarm ANY trap. So we find something that looks suspicious and we let him prove himself. He's sitting there for 10 minutes trying to disarm a weird little square of tile and a gout of flame shoots out of the wall next to him and sets his beard on fire! He runs around smacking himself trying to put himself out until our cleric finally extinguished him with a water spell. He stands there for a bit, beard half burnt off and drenched in water, looks at us and says 'just avoid that tile'.","36":"One time, a long while ago, Trudy and I were trying to nab some merchant’s permit from a fancy party and Trudy got made. So, to sneak her out, I hid her underneath my ball gown. We were both lucky my corset was big enough. Of course, leaving so suddenly would have been suspicious, which is how I spent 3 hours walking around a party with my sister under my dress. Thankfully, no one offered me a dance.","37":"Never step through a portal. Not once, not ever. My party went through a portal that was supposed to be a shortcut into a wizard's tower, right to the top. Promise of some quality wands in that tower, made us step through without thinking too hard on it. Five years later I came back to the Prime Material with no friends and no wands. I don't talk about those years. Just don't trust portals is all I'm saying.","38":"I won't stand for slander against Warforged. They got souls and I won't hear no arguments about it. No talk of 'tinmen' or 'automatons' at my campfire. You take that backwards thinking to your little farm and hang up your sword, because you ain't fit to be an adventurer. You fight with a 'forged at your back, or you listen to them talkin' about the friends they lost in the first war, and you would know. They might be more human than you or me. Certainly more human than an elf. Don't get me started on those knife-ears.","39":"Never wake a sleeping Gnome. I'm not kidding about this. Sure, you know not to wake a Barbarian, liable to get your arms chopped off, but Gnomes are worse. They can cast spells before they're fully awake, see? Still half dreaming. You haven't regretted a decision quite like getting polymorphed first thing in the morning.","40":"That flintlock you have there, may I see it? Ah, this reminds me of the rifle used by the infamous Tabaxi mage-slayer Odd Song Sung. I tracked that master assassin across this land, to-and-fro. Through battlefields and ruined cities older than you can fathom, yet she always stayed one step ahead. The last time I saw her, atop a tower above the street of Mordhau, eschewing her sights to read the charms she hung from the barrel of her weapon with fine chains as the winds of death shifted through them. I charged up those stone stairs faster than I have ever moved in all my days. But when I burst onto that damn platform there was nothing save for a single scrap of parchment held under a lose stone. 'Goodbye my friend' it said in a curling script, 'it has been an honour fleeing you'. I never saw that Tabaxi again.","41":"When you're in those swamps, never, I repeat, never follow the lights, I've seen what happens, some might drown in the muck, others might get ambushed by lizardfolk, those are the lucky ones, the unlucky ones, they get torn to shreds the fog itself ripping them to shreds like a butcher, so fast they don't have time to scream...I've seen things, are you sure you still want to go out there?","42":"... and so there 'e was when Oi' saw 'em, bold as a blacksmith strikin' hot-steel, 'e struck that demon on the fore'ead wif 'is fryin' pan! Oi'll ne'er outlive the day! Oi' outlived 'em tho' tha's fer sure, poor bloke 'uz ripped in 'alf shortly thereafter, e' wuz! But Ser Percivale 'e bought tha' rest'a us poor blighters enough time for Brofver Caedsmuire to Banish em, and tha's th' reason Oi' carry this f'oine fryin' pan on me belt, see? 'Sides from bein' 'imm-a-nent-ally prack-ti-cal', it's one-a-them 'Me-minty.. Me-minnow.. Me-mento Mor-as' and prack-ti-klee an ''oly relic'!","43":"I used to be a blacksmith, but I got run out of town after a string of unlucky lasses had bairns which looked a mite too much like me. I ever tell you the time I had to shoe the Lord of the Nine Hells' Mare? A Nightmare they calls 'em, and she tweren't no mare, I tells yah... well, anyway she were a mite skittish, and so I took hold of her bridle and trotted her a bit, and I tell you each stride of hers was seven leagues, and dragged me along for the ride, and each time she would stop at the house of a lonely local lass and t'wouldn't budge a step afore I had made a call, then after that mare she'd take another step (with me for the ride) to the next maid's cottage, and on and on you see...","44":"My party would agree but I was the worst bard they ever had. Let me tell you a story to illustrate how bad I was. So here we were taking the time to refresh ourselves in the city when we find out that the town is using some weird magic to keep the place going, some type of sinister version of Druid magic. So there we were investigating when my party member ups and attacks one of the guards because they were in our way despite all of us agreeing to be discreet. So in a panic and also because I felt bad for the guy I casted healing word in hopes of maybe getting the guards off our back by being nice. Well I took out my flute and blew the flattest note my ears have ever heard and I saw that man cough up blood because regardless. If that situation wasn’t so crazy I would’ve laughed my head off that I actually hurt someone with healing word but hey you live and learn and I needed a lot to learn.","45":"Wanna know how I got these scars? Biggest dragon you've ever seen...probably the ugliest too. Anyways me and my mates were hacking him up when he took a wild swipe at me because I insulted his gecko mother. So there we were, me in his claws at least 500 feet in the air. I wrench myself free, climb up to his back and give him a good one two, ride his lifeless corpse all the way back to the hoard. We crash and I am launched noggin first into this beautiful baby I've on my back right now. This greataxe cut me up nice that day, but all the best lovers do that's what I always say!","46":"You want to know where I got this sword huh? What if I told you I had to go the ninth hell and debate Asmodeus? Or the depths of pandemonium where I lost at least two friends and forgot one other? Mayhaps I got it from the githyanki pirates that killed my dog so I killed them all in return? Or maybe it was fashioned from the brain stem of the beholder that insulted my previous sword size? Perhaps I got it from the ancient vault of Dren'Dar the conquerer after we defeated his ancient blue dragon lover? Or perhaps I got it from Freaky Falzahad's Magic Emporium down the street? You'll have to buy me two or three more ales to find out, friend.","47":"Trust me pal, the best part of adventuring is the food. You ever had dragon stew spiced with the ancient herbs found in a tomb and the marrow of a direboar? Ugh... Speaking of direboar...the tenderloin with a little high altitude mashed potatoes gardened by an centaur? You havent lived friend. Or granita (fruit ice) made by various fruits you had frozen during a fight with a white dragon? Refreshment for days. I could go on for years my friend, but I have another dish calling my name, until next time!","48":"I lost this hand fighting sirens a mile off the coast, oh... ten years back, I reckon. I keeps a leather pouch of the bones to remind me of my mortality; each drilled and filled with a mix of tin, lead, and a shaving from a single sterling piece, blessed by a priest of Saint Quimbles; and etched with the runes. Shalls I cast them and divine thy fate?","49":"Best not to deal with nobility who ask for discretion in carrying out their tasks. Better yet, best not to accept a blabbermouth into your ranks. Best not travel to the shadiest part of town and loudly announce your search of information on an assassination plot. Best not to blindly follow the kind old gentleman out of town, as he knows the assassins' hideout. Best not to let your guard down and invite an ambush on your friends. Best not leave them to their deaths in desperation towards saving your own skin. Best not let your past force you into a life of running and hiding. Best not to deal with nobility who ask for discretion.","50":"There we were, about to be over-run by the damned, our backs against the fallen portcullis, when out of 'er satchel Sister Bloeddwyd Angelique pulled forth the candle prepared by the Holy-Matron and blessed by the Light. When she lit her taper, the candle shone forth a light fit to blind us! She placed the candle in the lock of the portcullis and a great flash and shout of a hundred wrathful angels blew us an opening! I'd not be sitting here telling you the tale were it not for her!","51":"Never underestimate a Kobold, ye hear? Me brothers in arms wound up as food in thier cook fires, and I'd be there too if'n I didn't high-tail it the moment I saw those first traps! Oh, aye, you call me a coward, but I'll ne'er go down any hole where'st I's s'pect them scaly buggers to be lurkin'! You's best be doin' the same as I, and mind yourself! Mark me words!","52":"Aye, nowhere, no place in this world leaves you weary as the blasting fields. Scores of brave men and women have been swallowed by the harrowed place. For what? Glory. Ha. Riches. What vanity we had. The earth rumbles with every step you take. The smell burns your eyes and the air takes your senses. Me and my mates, brave as we once were, never feared it though. We should’ve. We should’ve feared the jets of fire that shot out like columns holding the sky above. But we didn’t. No. We marched, knowing the dangers. Knowing the risks. Knowing the rewards. Damn our arrogance. If we weren’t foolhardy enough to turn at the sight of that place, we certainly hadn’t the mind to beware the creatures that called the place home. That’s where I found out how true horror felt. How it seeps into your bones.","53":"I was a hired by a small band of naïve adventurers to guide them through the mountain passes in early winter. We should have turned back when the skies began to darken. But the gold... The storm hit hard and a thick, heavy blanket of snow covered every discernable landmark. The storm continued without end. I soon lost my way but, I kept that to myself. Because, the gold... Wolves took two of them in the dead of night, one froze to death after falling through the ice, and the last one? After six days in that frozen hell, I was the only one to walk out. But the gold...","54":"(While tuning a lute) Have I played 'The Mouse and the Magister' for you yet? That used to be my specialty. Never failed to get the people clapping and the gold flowing. Now how did it go? 'La de da... mouse...' That's not it. When I played this for the Queen of Names she made me a knight on the spot. That's a true story. You can call me Sir, please and thank you. 'La de da de da... mouse...' Damn... Let me just play 'Sunrise Over Waterdeep' for you again.","55":"I'm telling you, first time I fought one it was called a Water Normal. That was many moons back now, you can believe that. Water Normals, used to pop out of wells in villages, just about every harvest, sure as the crops. Then a few decades go by and they're not so regular, we start to hear them called Water Uncommons. Over hunted, see? Nowadays you almost never see them. You worry much when you get water from a well? You're welcome. And so, yes, Water Weird, because they are now.","56":"Just sos you know, you can dance with the dead in the pale moonlight. It ain't the dancin' that's the problem, it's the leavin' after. Their grip is a might bit stronger than a clamp o' iron. It probably wasn't worth the gold my pals bet me to do it. (He/she shows off a huge scar). You should've seen the other guy, though.","57":"We once convinced a kobold colony to mine out a block of stone in the ceiling of a dragon's lair, dropping in on their head. Dragon problem done just like that, though, those damn kobolds did drive us out before we managed to take a share of the dragon's hoard...","58":"I only loved one man: Bernar was his name, and what a fine man he was. He could swing an axe like a twig, and drank brandy like it was water. I had to leave him, however... I took a contract to hunt down a hag. Turns out my suspicions were right.. it was my mother in law!","59":"Now, I COULD spend the next turn of the hourglass telling you lies about the best way to wield a longsword; lies I learned guarding the Duke, and learned were lies when the Masked Menace cut the Duke's Demon-possessed head clean off; but since you're buying me a drink, tell me a bit of your travels?","60":"Throws his drink at the painting of a wealthy nobleman. Noble my rear end! I've seen that man make love to a sheep after just 2 cups of mead. That ironbrained oaf still owes me 30 gold pieces too. I won it fair and square in a card game. He said he was good for it and I let him off the hook at the time but I should've taken his thumb as collateral and I woulda been justified to do it too. The healer I ran with at the time could've put it back on 3 weeks later in just 10 minutes I tell ya.","61":"That sure is a nice weapon you have there, young adventurer. But it's not about the size or value of the weapon, but the way that you use it. The older adventurer reaches for something strapped to their back and brings it into the younger adventurer's vision This here is 'Pointy.' My party and I were asleep in the forest one night, when I woke up surrounded by goblins and the sounds of screaming and crunching. No weapons, no armor, and my fellow adventurers were already as good as dead. The only thing nearby was this one strong, arm-span long, and unusually pointy stick. It must have been sent by divine beings that cast pity on me because it seemed to shine as I quickly reached for it. I picked it up, and I just started jabbing it at every goblin that came near me. Quick thrusts. I aimed for the eyes. I was there all night, and, just as I was about to collapse from exhaustion, the sun started to rise, and the goblins, many of whom were missing at least one eye each at this point, retreated. Ever since then, I have always kept Pointy with me to remind me that the most humble of tools can have the greatest of effects, to remind me of my lost comrades, and, well, in case of goblins.","62":"Speaking of alcohol, if you ever go to the Pinepoint Inn down the street NEVER drink more than one pint of their Hunter's Meade. I know it may be delicious, but I did it a couple of years ago and I woke up in a cave surrounded by a group of Kobolds who apparently started worshiping me as their new regent. Took me three weeks to get out of there! I can hold my liquor, but I'm never drinking Hunter's Meade again.","63":"The Icy Wastes are cold, cold, cold I tells ya! Only madmen and the darkest of evil travels there! I lost a hand and a leg to the cold, after I followed the Lost Prince and the Crusade to find the Egg! We found the Egg alright; it was beautiful, like a singular jewel, just sitting there on the altar of the Icy Temple, glittering for all to see! Then the men began to scream and freeze into place! I ran away, dragging my frozen limbs, of fifty men that went in, only three returned, and the Prince was not one of them!","64":"A cloaked and masked lady once hired us to take her deep into the woods, then bade us keep our distance while she spent the night alone atop a hill crowned with a ring of faerie stones. She never told us her name and commanded us never to speak of it. But do you remember the festivities when old Queen Gennereth turned out not to be barren after all? And isn't her daughter a rare beauty, like something you've never seen? Makes you think.","65":"Before you use your spell casting powers to win the affections of a fair woman or gallant gentleman remember the tale of the wizard Geniinewab. When Geniiwewab heard that the fair maiden Alessandra's beloved crow was ill he trapped all the town clerics in a forcecage so that Alessandra would be forced to consult him instead. In an effort to demonstrate his magnificent power Geniinewab killed Alessandra's crow with finger of death and then used a wish spell to revive it. The night after casting that wish spell Geniinewab caught the flu. Since the great wizard was enfeebled by the wish spell and all the town healers were locked up Geniinewab died within a week.","66":"Now, don't believe a word they say 'bout the moon being made of green cheese. I should know, I was there, me and my mates, you see, we sailed there one night when we were lost in a thick fog off the coast of Nuperie... Just remember when sailing, if you see a big fog bank roll in under a moonlit sky.. you should turn the ship right around and 'Nuperie' right out of there! Ha Ha Ha!","67":"My faithful hounds!', they's call us, their Majesties would! Why.. hold on, my neck itches.. would you scratch it? These old arms can't quite reach behind.. ahh! Oh yiss, thats divine.. that thumping noise? Oh.. sorry.. my leg does that when I get scratched there.. well anyway, they used their baleful magics to turn us into the very hounds they imagined us as, the party and I, you see.. we spent a good six years in that state, hunting the nine-tailed fox spirits! How'd we change back? Well their Majesties got offed by a party of adventurers, and wouldn't you know it, we changed right back to ourselves... Petersen though still had that awful case of magical fleas!","68":"Now now.. where's my pen and paper? I must certainly write down an account of your travels, they seem comparable or even to eclipse my own, most remarkable tales... most remarkable! Why, I too, recall coming up against savages, and thought my solution to be quite ingenious, you see, my party and I would replace the gemstone eyes of their idolatrous god with costume jewelry INDISTINGUISHABLE to the real thing... unfortunately, someone had already beaten us to the punch! The gems were fake the whole time! Oh, you should have seen Lord Perfidy's apoplectic face! He kept that face for the few moments of his life he had remaining after taking that savage's spear to the guts! Which, I daresay, still haunts me whenever I close my eyes for more than a moment...","69":"...that little spark and glimmer in a person's eyes when you JAB your blade into their GUTS and they are seconds away from slipping out of this reality? Oh, my favorite look indeed! Yours?","70":"Me? I knew th' 'Dread Pirate Roberts' back when 'e was just known as 'The Mildly Frightening Pirate Roberts'! T'was I what gave 'e and his 'ole crew th' idear to re-brand, I did! S'truth!","71":"... And THAT is the story of how I lost my leg! You ready to hear the story of how I lost my... oh what? Out of time? I'm sorry Children, that story will have to happen at another time! Good bye! Be good now, Children! So long! Byeee! Now, mates, where was I? Oh yes, the story of how I lost my right eye! It's a sordid tale involving the most beautiful ghost lady-captain I ever did see! Our love was one for the ages! I had my eye removed and magically enchanted to only ever see her, I did! And that was how I came to lose my Left Hand! You see it was shortly after...","72":"... and THAT, my friends, is why you don't go sticking ANY part of your AN-AT-OH-MEE anywhere near a mimic what looks like a KEE-YOOT little innocent stuff-ed an-ee-myool, no siree! Why that poor himbo over there lost more than one peice of his elf to that mistake! What? He looks fine to you? Why that boy is devastated! Devastated!","73":"Now, I'm usually pretty good with the ladies, no lie, but I tell you when I, in a drunken stupor, asked the Goddess Ishtar for a kiss, and got one! Why, I was over the moon! That night we made sweet, passionate love... you should have seen it! raunchy humping motions... but.. I feel I can trust you with this, the next morning, there was a donkey in my bed!! I never did see where Ishtar went, and now mere mortals just aren't the same. Ever since then I've decided to limit myself to just ten, ten drinks.. maybe twenty a night, so's the next time I see that Goddess, I won't pass out and get to see her afore she leaves...","74":"And on tha twelfth night, it 'as exactly as dark as on the 'leventh, but then BAM! suddenly tha' brightest light I never did seen came shinin' outta that tower and ALL the demons of Hell a'came a'riding out of it, it near sounded like.. the light made that much noise, jennle-men, I guarantee.","75":"When we moved to break into the block wall bricking up the secret passage, we found the body of someone who died trying to escape. Their fingers were worn to stumps and the back of the blocks were bloody. Never did find out what scared 'em so.","76":"All I'm sayin' is a good adventurer needs a good pair of gloves. Too many potion sellers don't wash their hands, and who knows what kind of poison is gonna get under your nails? And besides, if you hold your weapon without a pair, your palms will get all calloused. Mine are smooth as a baby's bottom, wanna feel?","77":"If you're ever in the deep forest, and come across a clearing you've not seen afore, empty save for a ring of mushrooms, turn around, and walk away. It ain't worth your troubles, believe me. You know how hard it is to escape the Fae? Damned bastards took me for everything I had, and I'm lucky at that. And this damned mark on my hand never did fade, either.","78":"I remember once back in my mercenary days, we were besieging this walled city... on a hill... on a peninsula. Perfect defensive position, right? Our employer was smart enough to know that a normal assault would have been suicide. So we just blasted the place with explosive spells. Days and days of hurling fire and lightning at those walls while trying not to get shot by their archers... I can still hear the booming in my ears sometimes. Eventually we brought a wall down and stormed the city. Damned messy business.","79":"It was the third month of the Long Cloud, by our reckoning. I was out hunting when I saw some shady looking folk around what looked like an altar. I laid there for a little, listening to them chant gibberish, but I knew I couldn't take 'em all in a fight. Left a few traps for the bastards, though. Never found out if they were behind the whole thing.","80":"Lemme tell you something kid, wizards are all fine and dandy... as long as they stick to the normal spells. But you ever meet a wizard who goes on about experimenting, and new forms of magic... you get out of there. Nine times out of ten that whole thing will end in a big explosion.","81":"These ales are practically water! A true man's drink can only be found in the Crested City. They use their crystals, ya see, and grind 'em up and put 'em in the drinks. Stronger and better than any other! I need to get back there some day.","82":"Aliases are healthy, kid! You give a false name when dealing with anyone that might want you harmed. Not to mention fairies and the like. I've got a dozen or so names you might find around the country! Of course this isn't my real one either. You really think my parents named me Mortimer?","83":"I don’t take drinks or food from people I don’t know. Got me in trouble quite a few times in my youth. I thought myself as quite charming, and tried making conversation with a Hag my party and me were having dealings with. Asked about the pot of soup she had cooking behind her, and instead of an answer I got a bowl full of the stuff. Well, I couldn’t just back down from a challenge, could I? It tasted alright, and the she told me about the slaad eggs she had planted in it. Told me I had three months before it would erupt and kill me, unless we went and got the scales of a black dragon for her. Lucky for me, I could think on my feet, and so I stuck my fingers down my throat and puked the monstrosity out onto her! Oh, she was raging mad, and my party was about ready to kill me after we fought her. But it all worked out alright, didn’t it?","84":"When the King did call for brave 'venturers explorin' the frontiers, I did answer the call. When the King did demand we'n all lay down our lives and clear these lands in 'is name, I did, and my wife and children too! And, when it were them what lost that life an' I forced to remain these 15 years past, what does the King and Crown do when dark-forces do gather and threaten all we have done? Does e' go reward our service? Does the Crown protect? Nay! The Crown abandons us! Mayhaps we should abandon the Crown...","85":"Fire, I says; 'tis your best friend an' t'worst enemy t'at the same time! Sees this scar 'pon me face? Flask of oil 'xlpoded afore I could throw 'er when the party and I faced off against that dark wizard Woss'zname? Frank!? Frank me boy, what was that wizard's name? The one where I got this scar strangling the life out of with these two hands!? Oh, Frank's asleep I see. Too boring for you, eh Frank!??!","86":"When Ser Porthe fell in battle off the far shores of Guthay, we saw fit to preserve the body from putrefaction by storing it in a cask of fine Canary that had previously been Ser's favorite. Seeing as not to waste any, as they likely took up quite a bit of the barrel, we shared a goodly portion with the fellow crew, before sealing. Now, I dare say, I scarcely can take a glass without remembering and mourning the fact that we still lack the golds required for their resurrection... Let's Toast to Good Ser Porthe! Ser Porthe!","87":"I came here to drink and forget the heaps of trouble my spouse lays upon me on a daily basis. Oh fer certain, I marched with the Lord against that vile Hag and their coven, but no matter how far we marched we could never catch em. Each night we lost a soldier or more, when they ran from the camp screaming of night terrors, we usually found their bodies in the morning... tell you the truth, Id rather be there than back home with the fractious family, some days...","88":"Loudest t'ing I never did 'ear, I confess, wuz tha 'splosion of tha Powder Stores on tha' Good Ship Lawbringer. Oh she brought tha law that day, I was on 'er, and she brought tha Law of Unintended Consequences! Shattered tha port, and collapsed tha channel, she did, and collapsed tha sea wall too! Lost us tha battle, and tha city when they gained entrance via tha hole. I managed ta survive, but I lost my hearing and was imprisoned and then enslaved for six years! Was a miracle and a steep one I paid for, when a travelling cleric healed me, and took me from that place...","89":"You 'kiss the toe' yet? S'posed to be a ritual, you know. A warnin' against those who dont pay their tab. I got a deal I did! Thats my toe, I paid my tab with it! You wouldnt mind buyin me a drink now, would ya?","90":"I tells ya, I saw FOUR, FOUR! masked Tortles down in those sewers! Meanest I ever came across. Scuffled with 'em once on a run for the society, see.. they kept shouting if I wanted a piece-a-them, well.. when I saws they were all armed, and with that tough shell.. well, I turned tail and ran. Now, don't go thinking me a coward now, when I found out they took down that Grell, that golem, and those masked warrior monks that worshipped it? Well.. seems I made the smart choice, friend-o; the smart choice!","91":"Y'all ever heard of the snail that wouldn't die? Once we were delving in a deep forgotten dungeon, looking fo' loot and other bits. Well we found some, a great big chest that was lock'd like sumfin tough. Well our sneakthief open'd it and there weren't nothing but single snail, still living but it didnt have no food in there. Little thing started to crawl out towards the north, ignoring everythin' we did to it. Scared me silly, still never did get us no loot from that place.","92":"... so trapped as we were and with days before help would arrive, we did what we had to to survive. I'm not proud of want we did, but I challenge any decent creature in the same position to do different. Anyways, I'll tell you something for nothing. Kobold doesn't taste anything like chicken.","93":"Once knew human. Skinny little thing she was. Ranger. Good with a bow. Obsessed with herself. Beauty treatments, strange potions. You name it, she'd try it. Got herself hold of some paste with flail snail muck in it. Rubbed it all over her skin. The next morning, she started glowing all different colours. Real bright like. Never laughed so hard in my life. Like watchin a magic show. Took us weeks and weeks to find a wizard to reverse the effects. Sometimes, when she hiccuped, she'd still let out a little burst of colour.","94":"All nobles are bastards, right? Only some are bigger bastards than others. Myself and a group of, um, compatriots got ourselves hired by a bunch of farmers to defend a town and a handful of villages from some hobgoblin raiders. Couple days in, we mange to capture one alive. Turns out the local baron was the one that hired them. He wanted to raise taxes and was using the raids as an excuse. Anyway, long story short, the baron ended up on the wrong end of a hobgoblin sword and the lads ended up being very well paid.","95":"Take my advice son, steer clear of fey. Don't mess with the little ones and steer clear of the big ones. Don't talk to them, don't even look at them if you can avoid it. Carry some cold iron on you, just in case. And especially, don't bargain with them. No good can come of it. There's a reason they call me 'Tails' and it ain't because I'm a good story teller.","96":"My arm? Did I lose my arm in the war? Well, let me put it this way young person. The next time a wizard tells you to keep your arms at your sides during a teleport spell, you do it!","97":"(Hoarse voice) Harum... I haven't cough... haven't seen much of folk in the past year, bit out of practice talking. But been out on my own since I uh... lost my adventuring partners to a wolf attack. (scratches their neck, a bite scar is visible on it) Biggest wolf I ever seen, tore through four of us like we was thin cloth stretched over bales of hay. Bowled me over onto a rock, hit my head and was out for I don't know how long. (clears throat and it sounds like a low growl) Came to and that beast was gnawing on what was left of my buddies, muzzle soaked in blood. I must've made a noise because it suddenly looked at me, eyes ablaze... (glances nervously at the moon breaking through the clouds) That was the unluckiest and luckiest time of my life. It jumped me, slowed down I guess from being gorged on my friends. Got its jaws locked on my throat but I got a hand up in time, saved me from getting killed instantly. (holds out a hand with deep, ragged scars all along it, highlighted in the glow of the campfire) Figured I was done for but my other hand happened to fall on what remained of our priestly fella. Whatever god he worshiped must've put his dagger right where I'd grab it. I just stabbed blindly. Maybe hit something important 'cause the creature leapt away like it was seared with a hot poker. (pulls out a fancy dagger, more ceremonial than practical, its silvery blade shining. The speaker's voice grows more hoarse, a barking cough escaping their lips) Kept it with me ever since... just... in... caaaaasse.... (And the moon breaks from the clouds entirely, bathing the campfire circle in its pale glow as the speaker bends double with a howl of pain as their limbs start to contort...)","98":"I got lost in a good book, once. Took me pages and pages to find my way out, and you ask me where my fingers on my left hand went? Paper cuts, I tell yah! Damn thing up and swallowed me whole while reading! Was my favorite book too...","99":"Strange lad? You want to hear something strange? Well, I adventured with this mage for a couple of years. He was a bit ... odd. Kept to himself mostly, very private and shy. Insisted on separate sleeping quarters. Mumbled a lot. We all figured, y'know, magic user. Weirdness. Paranoia. Odd behaviour. Strange smells. It comes with the territory. Too much mercury and bat shit in spell components. Anyway, we get hired by this prince to get rid of a gauth and when we tracked it down, the thing just laughed and laughed at us. Then 'gulp', it ate our mage, all in one go. Then, it spat out three Batiri goblins. One. Two. Three. Whole and intact. Damnedest thing I ever saw. When the gauth stopped laughing, he thanked us for the meal and entertainment and said he'd be moving on. Turns out, the little buggers had found some kind of enchanted cloak and had been sitting on each others shoulders. Had us proper fooled.","100":"Fundamental rule of adventuring my friend: always, always, always make sure your potions haven't expired. Knew this elf that left a potion of animal friendship in his backpack for a wee bit too long. We were trying to get past some wolves at the mouth of a cave, and he remembered this potion. Well, the wolves became friendly. A little too friendly if you get my drift. That poor elf, he had creatures coming at him from all directions. Spent the next few hours running around trying to avoid the attention of bears and bats and birds. Let that be a lesson to you all: test before you taste."}},"Fortunes":{"type":"Text","results":{"1":"Beware of the blinding red light. If you see this light, you must flee.

The number of false items increases as the room grows more cluttered. A well-organized room may have a small golden statue appear, for example, but a messy room could hold several arcane tomes and magical weapons. If the afflicted touches one such item, it instantly turns to a thick, foul-smelling ink that appears to stain their hand and any other items on contact.

A low hum sounds in your ear. The planet takes up more of the sky- you can’t look away from it. It fills your field of view far beyond what should be possible. Something beneath those black seas slithers, hunting, hungering, starving. You blink, and the feeling is gone.","77":"You hear the voices of your childhood best friend, describing some childish adventure you went on together when you were young, jumping and laughing and playing in the wilderness. As the story goes on, your friend becomes quieter and his voice wavers, as he talks about that ill-fated leap, where you jumped too far, fell, and died. The voice fades.","78":"Your weapon begins insulting you, berating you and calling you a failure. Your armor and tools try to defend you and they start arguing.","79":"Your fellow party members begin to resemble large, humanoid, chittering crabs.

It’s a tiny, almost insignificant different, but It is very noticeable when in direct conversation with them because they never make actual eye contact. They look the smallest bit away.","39":"The afflicted has seen the errors of popular belief and have decided to be as counter to the norm as possible.

Take 3d10 psychic damage as you struggle to reconcile this, and the madness ends.","51":"You now believe you are the physical incarnate of the deity you have devoted your life to.

The voice they've been hearing, 'attaches' itself to the item, and 'speaks' through it. The item then MUST be obtained. Finally, any choice the inflicted makes must be made through the toy.","58":"Character becomes extremely sadistic. Deaths elicit the most laughter - the gorier, the more happiness is achieved.","59":"A fear of growing older is instilled in them--and a desperation to never grow feeble. Impatience is formed as a result of the knowledge that with every passing second they are slowly dying, and as such they have a short fuse.","60":"They must save everyone!

However, they are too afraid to try to commit suicide in order to wake.","86":"The afflicted has a dream, in which they see their own death, in a rather specific way. The DM decides what the dream is like, so it is exactly like a situation the party will go through.

Roll 1d20 for each of these conditions: Memory loss; Loss of sight; Loss of taste; Loss of touch sense; Loss of hearing; Speech loss; Motor problems; Schizophrenia.

Seeing the sun frozen in place, and being a smart man, Dav knew he had to do something quickly or the world would plunge into chaos. He swiftly sprinted up the frozen sunbeams and used the heat of the owlbear carcass to melt the ice.

Upon approaching, the party sees that their beaks are lined with teeth, and the birds are twitching as though trying to escape possession. From the sounds inside, someone is clambering to hide within the building.","55":"Kobolds have been attacking the town. All wearing similar regalia and a matching symbol. a raving man claims to have escaped from the kobolds’ lair. He describes a terrible dragon as the source of worship for the kobolds. The dragon is really a pseudodragon with delusions of grandeur, trained in illusion magic and has duped the kobolds into gathering a hoard for him.","56":"In a large city, urchins are a regular problem. This trio of kidlets, however, has been luring travelers in to abandoned alleyways, where the deranged doppelganger among them eats the human and the other two children keep what was it his/her pockets.","57":"A dryad clad in wooden armor leans against a tree his side torn wide open. He hands the party a pouch full of tiny leaves. Taking a pinch and blowing them into the air will lead the party to an ancient temple entrance almost over grown with vines. When close the pouch of leaves crumbles to dust along with the vines covering then entrance of the temple.","58":"You find a small silver coin in the middle of a street and upon picking it up, in your mind you see a small hut deep in the forest. When you come back to reality, only you can see it but a small fae pixie glowing bright blue will show you the way.","59":"The party encounters a man running out from the wood-line, coming towards then. He appears to be in shock over what he has seen, and tells the party that he was attacked while hunting. The man directs the party to the spot were he encounter the creature.","60":"A local temple has reported strange events in the surrounding area: beasts attacking villagers, bandit lords more closer to the village, and mysterious lights and sounds that can only be observed from within the village.","61":"A bounty hunter asks the party if they known any of the names on a list of his. The list contains about 20 names, roll a d20 for the characters knowing any of the names, 1-10 unknown and 11-20 known. The names on the list can be from characters backstory or names of NPCs the party has met throughout the campaign. The bounty hunter will known what each person on the list as done, and how much the reward is for the capture.","62":"A seemingly exorbitant amount of gold is offered on the message board to get rid of a ‘house spider’. It turns out that it’s about a spider-like mimic in the shape of a house.","63":"The moon stops traveling across the sky, and everyone’s time pieces stop working. Word around the continent is a group of warlocks are attempting to gain power from a new patron – the god of Time","64":"More than three people in a given town have all their teeth fall out at the same time","65":"A nearby civil war is raging, and one of the high ranking officers of one side or the other holes up in a cave. If approached, they will act incredibly defensive. A child is crying somewhere deeper in the cave, and this person refuses to answer any questions about said child.","66":"An allegedly crooked officer of the law is found dead in an alley way and only one person in the whole town seems to care about it at all.","67":"The party is on a faire where a magician is performing tricks with a severed head that can talk. Throughout the show the head blinks in weird patterns. The party talks to the head to find out he is kidnapped and begs for help in finding his body back.","68":"The party comes across an Inn in the middle of nowhere and they decide to stay. They wake up on the ground where the inn used to be and there’s no sign of any building ever being there.","69":"Walking through town, the party suddenly gets surrounded by the city guard. A respected captain was murdered. Witnesses say they saw someone looking similar to one of the party members. Upon looking through their things, said member appears to have lost an item easily traced back to him (one half of a pair of gloves/earrings/daggers, family insignia, one of a kind necklace etc.). Sure enough, said item was found at the scene of the crime. Someone is framing them. Not necessarily a doppelganger.","70":"The party stumbles across a dead old man. Amongst his meagre belongings is a thick tome with extensive records about everything they’ve done right up till today, with even more detail than they themselves knew.","71":"The party finds various dead animals with missing pieces, almost torn and shred. As they approach the heart of the forest the number of dead creatures increases. Upon investigation they find out it’s the guardian spirit of the forest who has been corrupted and it’s confused.","72":"A flyer appears in the sacks of each party member. A mid level demon has opened a store and invites all those with ambitions to visit to make deals.","73":"A rumor reaches the party’s ears of a group of brigands hiding out in the woods. They have a code that is the reverse of Robin Hood and his Merry Men: Steal from the poor, and give to the rich. None of the local nobles seem interested in the pillaged goods of their subjects, and are constantly giving back the loot they keep finding on their doorsteps.","74":"The local apothecary is desperate due to the sudden absence of all the local medicinal plants in the area. All the groves and clearings appear to have been picked clean, and even the owner’s secret garden is now empty. She had told no one of her hidden garden, and so has no idea who or what could have taken all of the plants in the brief period of time between her most recent check and her previous one.","75":"A human peasant and a member of the fey came across each other in the woods and, over the course of multiple moonlit encounters, fell deeply in love. The peasant’s family has a deep-rooted fear of the fey, and is actively trying to put a stop to the pair’s relationship. The family is even more fearful that the peasant will leave for the Feywild and never return, and goes to the party to convince them to help break the two lovers up. The human is in love with the Fey’s otherworldly allure and sharp wit; talking to them makes the peasant feel alive in a way that they’ve never felt before. The Fey was originally only interested in the concept of a secretive human lover, but eventually came to love the peasant’s dedication to their relationship despite the risk of alienating other loved ones.","76":"While at the market waiting for another adventurer to arrive, you pass the time by idly counting the number of stone gargoyles mounted on the town hall. There are fourteen, all with a silly grin.","77":"While at the blacksmith to repair your armour, you overhear the blacksmith explaining to his apprentice to not stray off to the hills to see his new sweetheart because he heard from the baker’s cousin’s stepmother that there are kobolds about.","78":"While waiting patiently for your turn to see the Bishop, you get your ear bent by some local shopkeeper about how the town council is a bunch of idiots, and how they simply wasted all that money on getting 13 gargoyle statues erected on the town hall. Thirteen! That’s an unlucky number!","79":"A street urchin attempts to filch your purse, he runs off down an alley. The urchin escapes, but in the alley you found a homeless halfling bum. Clearly dead. Looks like he fell from a great height.","80":"The price of that foreign wine you like so much has tripled in price. The barkeep mutters something about pirates. The barkeep explains it’s just a euphemism for the wagoneers guild and their extortionate ways.","81":"A dead homeless halfling found in an alley had a small bottle of very cheap whisky. The label has a brand mark you’ve not seen before – 4 vertical slashes and 2 short slashes across the bottom.","82":"The pommel of a sword you found on your last adventure rattled loose. Inside you a scrap of parchment with lots of scratchmarks, almost looks like writing.","83":"A wanted poster has been nailed up – Wanted: Black Pete, for Brigandry.","84":"The scribe you made inquiries with last week has got back to you. She says the Tomb of Three Chieftains can be found outside Millthorp.","85":"While at market, you saw three wagons being carefully guarded by scruffy and shifty looking mercenaries. There are barrels of cheap rotgut in the wagon.","86":"A pilgrim accosts you in the street. He asks if you’ll be travelling east anytime soon.","87":"The bakery has no cake. He explains it’s because there’s a shortage of milk.","88":"A patrol of the Kings Guard rode fast down main street. They almost ran you over.","89":"There’s a parade of pilgrims on main street, heading for the commons. They appear somber and morose.","90":"Southbridge, just outside town, has been closed to traffic due to disrepair. Merchants complain about the 2 hour detour they now incur by first heading east.","91":"The town guard are seen practicing new drills on the common. Apparently a local bandit has enlisted a wizard, and so training in avoiding fireballs is called for.","92":"The local priesthood is paying gold for water collected from the Opal Caves to treat a spreading fever","93":"An apothecary will pay for certain herbs growing in the Frog Marches.","94":"The local Stonecutters Guild are not petitioning for work contracts; labourers are grumbling.","95":"A frost giant approaches the group. The giant politely asks for help. He lost his pet owlbear and needs help finding it. He promises a very handsome amount of gp as well as “a powerful ally” if you find the creature.","96":"A goblin in noble clothes crashes through the window and rolls over the ground. The symbol of the king’s guard is embroidered on his half-cape. As he gets up, he panics and looks around, fixing his eyes upon the party. “The Goat-Riders are coming! Please, hide me!”","97":"A large burly man has started a daily ritual of throwing a goat at the side of a local noble’s house. He is not damaging the house, so he is not doing anything that will make the local law enforcement arrest him, but the noble wants him dealt with, and will pay you to get rid of him, however.","98":"A sword in the stone can be sensed by all creatures in the land with “Detect Magic” but lately it seems that the presence is becoming overbearing. Magic users are worried that unless the true king draws the sword, proving his lineage, or the spell “Detect Magic” will become obsolete.","99":"As the group walks through the forest, one member hears very quiet crying. The crying is coming from a lost juvenile harpy. It is the job of the group to protect this harpy. They can either keep and raise the creature, or return it to its mother.","100":"The party finds a smouldering crater containing a metal wreck. Inside, they find an eccentric kobold who insists she has returned from the moon."}},"Travel Montage Events":{"type":"Text","results":{"1":"A (giant) eagle swoops in and steals something from the party.","2":"A heavy buzzing is in the air and something smells badly somewhere off the road. Investigation leads to a carcass of a pack animal covered in stirges who are feeding off of it. The pack animal seems to be carrying a saddlebag of some sort.","3":"Three farmers pass by with a small herd of goats and a cow. Several minutes later a man comes running along with a black eye, roughed up clothes, and holding a rake pleading with the party to tell him where the bandits went with all his livestock.","4":"You encounter some people seemingly migrating. They're migrating to the nearest city because they lost everything in a fire. They'll try to sell you things, one of them even tries to sell their daughter's hand in marriage for a handful of gold. They're that desperate to not end up as beggars.","5":"The sound of hooves traveling at great speed comes towards you on the twisting roads. Make some wise decisions because there are over a dozen horses galloping at high speeds along the road in a drag race for some serious prize money. They leave you in a huge dust cloud as even more pass. A straggler has fallen off his horse but he is stuck in the stirrups.","6":"A group of 15 rough looking soldiers have barred the road with two heavy carts. They will roll them aside for a ‘’Duke’s aid’’ fee of 7 gold pieces per person. (They can be negotiated with up to 4 gold pieces but any lower and they turn sour and rather take some lives. Upon being met with hostilities they will overturn their carts and use the slits they cut in the bottom to shoot crossbows from almost total cover while their foot soldiers use a make-shift tower shield to advance on the party. If 5 of them die and they are not clearly winning they will give up and surrender.)","7":"In the morning, you find giant frogs rummaging through your stuff, searching for food. They're not hostile, for now. How do you deal with them?","8":"Near nightfall a rough and wild looking woman will approach the campsite and ask if she can share the fire. She will offer to share three hunted rabbits with the party in order to secure a place for the night. (She is a Werewolf, but does not want to harm the party. She simply wants some human contact. She does have some weapons, but the rabbits have not been caught with those.)","9":"There is smoke coming from somewhere out in the wilderness. (When you go near, the smoke stops but with a successful survival check you can locate a still slightly smoking tree trunk. A successful wisdom check however might reveal it to be a hidden chimney. A secret entrance to an underground lair of illegal brewers is hidden nearby under a large rock that can be pivoted sideways. The moonshiners produce something that is nearly toxic called Dova made with some weird herb. It is strong enough to burn a hole in a normal human’s stomach (as if drinking acid) and is specifically made for dwarves. They say one cup can get a dwarf drunker than a halfling in a keg. The three alchemist brothers will protect their turf at all costs.)","10":"A mudslide destroyed most of the road ahead and turned it into a slippery mess.","11":"You come across two young men, one of which is in noble attire and the other is rather clumsily holding a rapier that is too expensive. The noble (duelist) is exercising his right to call a duel, this peasant didn’t look where he walked and spooked his horse. (The peasant is clearly out of his debt but does what he is told as he fears for his daughter’s life (who is crying at the side of the road begging them to stop), he will most definitely be killed if this duel takes place. If the party interferes the noble will size them up and offer them a gold piece each to get out of his way and keep their heads when his father hears of their interference, in all senses this guy is a prick, but one of nobility. If met with hostility the young noble will bravely fight but upon losing (or dying) he or his father himself will make it a personal mission to ruin this party.)","12":"There is roaring and thrashing from somewhere off-road. A wounded griffon (or wyvern) is trapped in some poachers’ device and her left wing is damaged by some sort of bear claw device connected to a chain. The chain is locked and hammered into a tree stump, next to it lays the carcass of a goat that was probably used to lure her here. (The creature is very wary and will attack any humanoid on sight if it weren’t for her chain radius of 40 ft. Freeing her is not easy as she distrusts everything around her now. This is reinforced the moment someone tries to remove the chain as arrows fly from the shrubbery and the poachers return for their trophy, this turns the beast hostile again.)","13":"The party is split by a Goliath jumping from a tree in the middle, while bandits grab one character and hold them ransom.","14":"A noble steed comes galloping over the road, the rider is nowhere to be seen. (A skill challenge is needed to stop this beast from running on and calming it down (3 successes before 2 fails). Saddlebags with a crest embedded on them are filled with paper documents, a huge pouch of silver (425 sp), and some traveling rations. The saddle is also engraved and probably worth a pretty penny. The horse was stolen from an estate and the rider was thrown off and killed by the horse. Everyone in the region would recognize the crest.)","15":"A group of kids follows you from the hamlet you just passed by. They are shooting berries at the party using improvised blowpipes. ((+7 to hit, 1 bludgeoning damage) and throwing stones (+4 to hit, 1d4 -1 damage). They have set some weird traps in the surrounding forest to get away when followed (sweeping branch dexterity save, which cuts movement for that round on a success and deals 1d4 slashing damage on a fail).","16":"When you visit a roadside inn you walk into a showdown between 2 bounty hunters and their quarry. The whole inn is tossed and tables lay on their sides, close to the door a wounded (leg) bounty hunter winds his crossbow to shoot from cover assisting his companion that is now being boxed in from all sides. The three remaining half-orc marauders are slowly flanking the bounty hunter that has sought cover behind a broken table, a fourth half-orc lays dead in the center of the room with a crossbow bolt in an eye socket. Regardless, the bounty hunters are clearly losing against their prey.","17":"Near a small hamlet you spot a few children playing. One of them climbs in a tree, seemingly to reach a nest. It seems dangerous, and the children on the ground look uneasy.","18":"A monkey wearing a Fez jumps out of a bush in front of the party, looking at you. It tilts its head slightly, makes an obscene gesture and runs off.","19":"You got lost during your travels, and now you are all at a path ending in an overgrown mess.","20":"A fisherman struggles to pull his net up. (If assisted, it turns out to have been stuck on a small, impossibly heavy box.)","21":"A well dressed person claiming to be an inventor comes up to you, saying he has a compass that he claims points to the nearest demon. It points straight to a party member.","22":"You find an invite to a noble gathering that evening.","23":"You all fall into the natural trap of a large carnivorous plant.","24":"A traveler tries desperately to sell you a decent but mundane goat for 50gp. (He refuses to haggle. He looks emaciated. He was secretly cursed for ripping off a witch and can only try to sell this goat. If someone pays for the goat, it and the gold disappear and the man collapses.)","25":"A small but vicious dog wanders across the path.","26":"A few grizzly bears can be seen in the distance, sniffing for food.","27":"A hooded figure stands in a bend on the road. (It speaks with three voices in order: Deep, Normal, Very High Pitch: GO NO FURTHER PAY FIFTEEN GOLD. The figure is in reality three kobolds in a cloak. They will draw six daggers if the party refuses to pay a 15g tithe).","28":"You spot an outcropping of glowing stone on a rockface. A medium sized cave filled with primitive ochre paintings is hidden nearby and evidence of long abandoned fires inside.","29":"The ground through here is scorched and blackened, and charred remains of trees and bushes are standing dead and still.","30":"You hear beautiful, almost irresistible singing coming from the woods. (Upon investigation, they find a person that ticks all the right boxes in terms of attractiveness for them. It is a fey creature that will test their morality. If they fail, the creature will attack.","31":"You see curious lights in the woods, and feel compelled to investigate. (Will-o-wisps.)","32":"You hear beautiful singing, and upon inspection see a beautiful nude woman bathing in a river. (nymph, dryad, or other fey. Will test the character's morality. If they pass, they are given a gift, such as goodberries. If they fail, the fae will attempt to drown them.)","33":"You meet a shadowy figure at a crossroads. He offers a boon. At low levels this could be an item which is both beneficial and cursed. At high levels, it could be a wish that will turn sour.","34":"You meet a hobbled, impoverished looking man struggling to push a small cart. To your astonishment, the cart is full of gold, probably 1000 pieces! If the PC's help the man push his cart, he grows agitated and tells the do-gooders to leave. If the PC's steal the money, they find it is cursed. The money increases in weight to the very limit of what they can carry. If they discard the coins, they reappear in their bags the moment they turn their gaze away. The character cannot spend them, and when they attempt to give them away, the coins turn hot and burn them. The only way to get rid of the coins is to be robbed or to use a remove curse spell. The curse affects the first person to steal any coins. The remaining coins will disappear from wherever they end up and reappear in the first person.","35":"A group of druids watch the party from a good distance away. If approached, they will ask about who the party is, but reveal nothing about themselves. If followed, they prove very patient; they will simply wait until the following party gets bored (or lost) trekking through the wilderness after them.","36":"A large number of animals(somewhere between 20 and 200 depending on size) thunder across the path, either in front of, behind, or around the party. They may be migrating, or fleeing from some event.","37":"A falling star plummets to earth a good distance away.","38":"A construct of some kind (possibly a golem, or something lesser) is traveling the other way on the road. Due to its limited sentience, it cannot communicate its goals, but it is not hostile.","39":"The party comes across a wolf, seemingly dead in the middle of the path. It is actually playing dead and helping other wolves with an ambush.","40":"A stone monolith sits at the side of the road. It has writing in druidic, something about purifying the earth around it. It may disappear after the party goes more than 20 feet away from it (DM's discretion).","41":"You are famous adventurers and every town you pass flowers are thrown, and people flock to you. All manner of gifts and food are given.","42":"As the party sets up camp, a phantom riding a phantom horse and armed with a whip manifests and approaches the camp. The ghost says 'GO! We can not stop! It is not safe.' If the party is knowledgeable enough, they will recognize that the ghost is a military officer. As long as the party continues on the road, even if they are going slow, the ghost will follow behind appeased, but if someone stops, it will whip them to get them moving. The ghost will march them all night till morning, where it will say 'We made it. We are safe. They are far enough behind.' and vanish. The ghost was part of a military troop that was ambushed and killed in the night by orcs following them, which is why the ghost drives travelers through the night instead of letting them rest, even if there is no danger anymore.","43":"The party spots a baby animal (elephant, bear, hippo, whatever suits the environment) on the road only for a split second. Soon after, an angry mother comes blitzing at them from the flank.","44":"A shrine to an obscure and almost forgotten deity/deities, but kept in good condition with seemingly fresh offerings, and after a successful moderate difficulty religion check, somewhat matching to their preferences.","45":"The party comes across a clear babbling stream, stepping stone crossing, good banks, shallow enough to ford a lightly loaded wagon, and with good fishing too! A nearby druid is somewhat friendly with any travelers passing through with good intentions and a light step upon the land.","46":"The party comes across a lone goblin druid shapeshifter and his adopted giant wolf pack with pups. The pack seems well fed, healthy. There is a 50/50 chance the pack was tailing the party and visible only as brief glimpses, hoping to use the travelers to scare up game; otherwise, the party encounters the pack quickly crossing the road. The giant wolves have a carcass on a travois made of split wood and vines trailing behind one of the pack members.","47":"Someone has left a large corked jug on the side of the road, weighing 100 lbs. Inside it is a weakly protesting water elemental demanding to be let out (if the PCs can understand its language). The uncommon but crude looking jug is magically enchanted to contain an water elemental of up to large size, and when a command word is spoken and the jug is empty, once per week it can attempt to suck in such a creature (which can resist with a moderate DC STR or DEX save. The current occupant can be reasoned with, but there is a 50/50 chance it will attack anyone who sets it free (at least until it can find an escape route) even if the party has convinced it they are friendly.","48":"The party comes across a destroyed horse cart. The contents of the cart are strewn about, and drag marks lead into the bush. If the party investigates they find a griffin munching on the bones of a pack animal.","49":"Whoever is walking in front of the party accidently falls into a pit trap set by hunters to catch a wild boar. Shortly after, some wild boar charged right into the pit.","50":"As you travel through a heavily wooded area, you notice that the trees above you are filled with dense spider webs. Hidden amongst the webs are dozens of giant spiders, chittering and watching the party silently in the treetops.","51":"A stray dog begins to follow the party at a distance. With a good animal handling check, the dog will react to the party in a friendly manner. You can keep it or return it to its owner for a reward.","52":"A lone barbarian, armed with a greatbow, stands atop an abandoned watchtower near a narrow pass that the party will have to go through if they don't want to waste time. He shouts down at them they must pay his toll or die. Why does he think he can enforce a toll against a party of armed and powerful adventurers? Because he has two tamed Wyverns.","53":"As the sun is beginning to set, a ghost appears on the road, and points off into the forest. If the party follows the ghost, it leads them deep into the forest to its long dead body wishing to have its remains put to rest. If the party takes anything from the body, the ghost will attack.","54":"A fallen tree blocks the road ahead. As you approach, it quivers, shaking all of its leaves. Then the tree gets up, and you briefly see a face on the trunk. It turns and unsteadily walks away.","55":"The road literally ends, with a large tree, boulder, or hole filled with mostly uninteresting nothingness and seemingly impossible terrain on both sides. It is in actuality a superb illusion, with a DC21 Will save. Once past the obstacle, a powerfully petty creature will mercilessly mock anyone who went around, and then attempt to kill or rob them. An NPC nearby has suffered the same fate, and will reward the party for helping them across or around the obstacle.","56":"On the left side of the road is what appears to be a statue. Moss and weathering cover its surface, but beyond that it looks pristine. A gravestone lies at its feet (DM's discretion as to what is on it.) Inspecting the statue (DC 12 Investigation) allows players to spot arcane runes. Inspecting the runes (same DC arcana) shows that the statue is actually a Iron Defender or similar construct which guards the grave, and disturbing it will cause the construct to automatically attack the creature who disturbed it until they or the construct are destroyed. If the creature attempts to fix it, the construct lets them.","57":"You notice a movement in a patch of soil beside the road. Suddenly a small mole-like man appears out of the ground. He pulls a map and compass from his pocket. Takes a few minutes orientating himself. Then vanishes back down his hole.","58":"They come across a crossroads, as they try and take their first steps across it a horse runs past them, and more follow. All have riders yelling at the top of their lungs. Eventually the crossroads calms down, and a few people traveling behind it inform the players it is a horse-race, and that they are welcome to join in.","59":"As you travel past a farmer's field, you see a number of scarecrows above the wheat field, failing at their job as numerous crows sit atop each one. Then one of the scarecrows twitches, sending blood-soaked birds into the sky.","60":"You are crossing a large open plane, a ramshackle hut stands beside the road as you approach an old man who comes out of the hut and stands in the middle of the road indicating that for you to stop. He points to a scrawled sign which says “Tol 1sp pr persun”.","61":"The party comes across a roadside vendor selling squirrels. 'They make Crackerjack Pets!' he says. A mile down the road, a squad of bandits besets anyone who didn't buy at least one.","62":"An airship filled with rare and valuable flying fish, and its crew, makes an emergency landing nearby. The vessel is damaged and until it is fixed it will not fly. Meanwhile, the valuable cargo is rapidly spoiling.","63":"A team of fellow adventurers pass by that follow a radically different class system. There’s a thri-kreen gladiator, a forgeborn alchemist, an erathi champion, and an aetheryte cantor.","64":"A group of satyrs frolicking in the woods pass the party with no regard.","65":"The party notices several statues in the path around a traveling wagon. As they approach closer they notice some of the statues are in poses with expressions of fear. A basilisk, cockatrice or any other appropriate monster to the party's level is feasting on one of the victims in the bushes just off the path. Since it is preoccupied and full, the party can easily pass it unmolested unless they decide to attack it.","66":"A dog comes running toward your group; whimpering as it does. As it reaches your group, you can see it has blood on the side of its face and front legs. Barking at you for a few moments, it bounds off back into the nearby field.","67":"An old lady sits atop a large flat stone at the side of the road, strumming softly on a dulcimer sat upon her lap. As you approach, she asks the party if they can spare her three days worth of rations and water in order for her to reach the nearest town. If they do, she can cast one of the following spells for the party as payment: Scrying, Legend Lore or Locate Creature.","68":"You notice a barrel sat in the shade of a lone tree a mile outside of a small village. Your keen eyes spot flies buzzing about the edge of the sealed lid; the ground shows clear signs of the barrel having been rolled or dragged to this spot. If the party opens the barrel, they find the bloated corpse of a young man (Late teens) wedged in an unnatural pose inside. The bottom of the barrel still has about two to three inches of wine sat in it; and the young man appears to be dressed in the livery of a delivery company.","69":"A religious procession of many people in dark gray robes and hoods with large rounded points on the sides reminiscent of an owl's head. They are carrying owl feathers, live dormice in a clay and gilt glirarium (container habitat for fattening dormice for eating) large enough that it takes six people to carry it, and several hundred dead rats and mice strung up by their tails on poles carried between the processionals. If inspected closely, the rodents have a small gem hidden inside worth 10x1d10 gp each. They offer you little cakes made of millet, dried fruit, and honey, that are shaped suspiciously like owl pellets.","70":"A roadside latrine with 'honey bucket' (for defecating in) filled to the brim with a mixture of waste and random coins. The coins are a cruel illusion, surely, and the smell is bad beyond description.","71":"A cult of 39 individuals (calling themselves the 'Voyagers to the Astral Portal') wearing new, matching robes and footwear have arranged themselves in a small field near the road in such a way that they each occupy one of the stations of an imaginary flying ship or spelljammer and each carry toy versions of the devices a crewmate occupying that station would have: A ship's wheel, toy cannons, toy engine, etc. They offer punch, snacks, and other libations while they wait.","72":"A heavily armed adventurer is laying in a pool of their own blood and will bleed to death if they are not aided, they are so far gone they will only mumble that 'I can't... die like this...'. If the party manages to heal them. They will thank the party and tell them that they were climbing a nearby tree when they fell and were impaled straight through on its branches, the wound was so bad their healing potion couldn't even stop the bleeding. They managed to drag themselves to the road and are incredibly thankful to the party, and will give a magical item as a reward and will gladly be looking to return the favor. If they die they have several magical items on their person.","73":"A frantic traveler runs to the party after he pauses and catches his breath he explains his friend was picked up and carried off by several harpies and points the party in the right direction. The party doesn't have to travel far as the harpies didn't make it back to their roost before they began to argue, leaving their captive stranded on the roof of an abandoned barn as they argue atop some nearby trees. The party can rescue the captive from the roof if they are sneaky if they don't think they can win a fight against all the harpies.","74":"A siren calls out to the party as she has questions on 'Civil folk'. She loves a man in a fishing village just up the road on the party route. She wants to 'be with him forever' and is asking what a man from civilization can't be without for when she whisks him away. It's very clear the fisherman does not even know of her existence as she has never approached him before. If the party meets the man when they pass through the village he is already married. If the party confronts the siren she states that 'My love is true and eternal, I definitely deserve to be with him more.' and makes it clear she is going to go with her plan to kidnap the man to be with her.","75":"Fey creatures are having a party with drinks and food and welcome any travelers to join in the revelry! After the party joins, the fey welcome them to drinking contests and games of skill and promise that every win earns them some gold. However, if they lose, they have to give the fey something or suffer a curse, (up to the GM on what that is and how sinister the fey are, they might not mention the punishment on a loss until one of the party members loses).","76":"As you travel the road, a dark storm rages above you washing the cobblestones and dirt with a heavy fall. The lightning and wind conspire to reduce your ability to see up ahead as you try to find a campsite but your party soon spots a small flickering covered lantern attached to a roadside tavern. As you approach, you notice the door is swinging open in the night air. The sign hangs loose on one hinge and the chimney shows no sign of smoke. Then the lightning reveals the strong, steady flow of blood pouring down the front doorstep.","77":"You come across a roadside altar dedicated to the 'Patron Saint of Safe Travels'; covered in small offerings of food items, coins and trinkets. Provided the party makes a donation/offering to the shrine, they may roll a d100 and add the value of their offering (single highest valued item if multiple are donated). If they score 95 or more, they receive a small blessing for their journeys for the week in the form of Advantage on all Perception rolls to avoid encounters.","78":"A traveling tinkerer asks the party to share a meal with him. The food is good and, if complimented, will repair their things for free.","79":"Something massive blots out the sun for a moment, but nothing is found in the sky. Moments later, a large carcass crashes beside the road, mostly eaten. It has eaten so it probably won't go after your horses.","80":"A fallen tree blocks the road with old cart tracks leading off of it. In the undergrowth, the remains of a cart are found with a pair of skeletons huddled beneath it.","81":"The party hears a lot of hounds barking before they round the next turn in the road. On making the turn they see an isolated farm with an elderly couple sitting on a bench on the side of the road surrounded by several large dogs. On a word from the woman the dogs go silent and sit patiently. She is selling her hounds for 200gp each. They are very well trained beasts with stats far above those of other dogs with an amazing perception unaffected by sleep or being unconscious. If the dog is rendered unconscious from a magical sleeping spell it can't wake up from, it will still bark and growl when it senses danger.","82":"The first time the party sees their destination on the horizon, spread out before them in a fresh vista. They still have a ways to go, and maybe some more challenges ahead, but the destination is finally real, you know?","83":"A bridge or ferry crossing near the frontier. A natural choke point, before the oath splits. The party's first encounter with a rougher sort, out here on the edge of civilization.","84":"A little girl was playing in the forest, and she left her favorite dolly there. Now it's night and she can't sleep without it! She will be too worried. After all, the forest is haunted at night, they say, and her dolly could be in trouble! Please get it for her right away!","85":"A group of drunk dwarves on the road ahead are cheering and laughing and invite you to join. One of the casks that they were transporting sprung a leak, and it would be a shame, nay, an insult to the gods of the harvest, to let all that ale go to waste. If the party wizard offers to cast mending on the cask, the grumbling dwarves shoo them away. If the party joins the festivities and stays for too long, the dwarves become depressed and talk non-stop about their poor life choices and regrets.","86":"A nasty group of goblins carrying empty bottles and corks runs across the trail chasing a small group of screaming pixies.","87":"The party encounters unusual warning signs in an ancient language. When translated the signs seem to say, 'This is not a place of honor. We buried something here that was repulsive to us. Leave or die.' Investigating further, the party will come to a clearing full of intimidating stone spikes protruding from the ground at odd angles, and a massive black basalt altar in the center. Attempting to dig or disturb the site gives the party radiation poisoning.","88":"A crumpled piece of parchment on the trail. There's some writing on it but it's impossible to decipher without picking it up and opening it first. Inside are the words, 'Don't read explosive runes!' An acid fireball immediately explodes, centered on the reader.","89":"The party starts finding holes that were recently dug in the earth. The holes become more and more frequent as they approach a nearby river. Investigating further, in one of the holes is a cursing dwarven prospector, mad from exposure, and frantically repeating, 'where is it?' The old miner ignores any attempts to communicate with him.","90":"A stranger asks for help reading their map. The map has no cities or paths the party can recognize, but instead the key markings are waterways, wetlands, and major seasonal air currents. If the party successfully identifies where on the map they are, the stranger rewards them, transforms into a crane and resumes their migration.","91":"The party comes across an inn just off the main road. The innkeeper is in the middle of a shouting argument with a tax collector. The innkeeper seems to think the tax hike is personal, that the taxing lord holds a grudge and is trying to drive him out of business. The tax collector is arguing that the intended rise in pay for guards patrolling the roads should mean an increase in business for the innkeeper.","92":"A human young girl with filthy hair, derelict clothes and a backpack too big for her, approaches the party together with her 3 year old brother, who looks equally scruffy. In exchange for protection and food, the girl offers her service as a scout or a helping hand for the party to cook meals, clean and mend things, wash clothes, etc. (The siblings are out and alone for two months now after their village burned down and they lost their parents. The girl has an aura of magic as she is an untamed wild magic sorceress.)","93":"The party encounters an orc with a broken leg and his pet worg. Both are exhausted and will be grateful when food and water is offered. The orc broke her leg while fighting a bear, weeks ago. Goblins found her and brought her to their camp, pretending to help her. There she befriended the worg, which was treated badly and as she realized the goblins were about to eat her, she broke out and took the worg with her. She carries an important message or item within her pockets.","94":"The party hears strange noises and as they investigate the source, they find old overgrown ruins of what must have been a small monastery in ancient times. Inside a strange parade of several skeletons and zombies are all following a third zombie in the robes of a necromancer, walking in circles around a stone or an altar under some kind of ancient gazebo. Some inscriptions, runes, melted candles, a book and some notes from the necromancer can be found on and around the stone. (The necromancer failed an experimental ritual here, which eventually gave him the small army he wanted, but turned himself into a zombie in the end.). When the undead are aware of the group, they will immediately attack.","95":"The party finds the remains and gnawed off bones of a goblin splattered across the way. It has artificial wings attached to both arms. The wings were attached using leather strips and they are made out of wooden sticks, thread, tar and a lot of feathers of different birds. The strange thing is, there is no tall tree, hill or cliff nearby.","96":"Walking towards a bridge, the group sees a troll and next to him two soldiers in full armor. As the party approaches, the troll rises with a sigh, uses his big index finger to count the group. He over-counts by one, then reaches into a big bag on his belt and hands out a number of gold coins accordingly. Doing so, he grumbles: “Me never take gold without paying tax again”. The guards greet you all with a smile.","97":"A gnome is screaming high up in a tree. Below her a pack of wolves try to get to her. If the party rescues the gnome, she will be very thankful and hand the party three arrows (or bolts) made of glass. These are magical arrows. Once the arrow hits a large or smaller object or creature that is not fastened to something else, the position of the shooter and the target are swapped. Regardless of this, an arrow shot this way breaks on impact and loses this ability.","98":"As the group walks through a field of lush grass and flowers, they find a group of two feet high stones, placed in a row. The number of the stones equals the number of party members and the patterns and profiles of each stone resembles loosely one of the party members.","99":"The party comes across a sign that informs them that the path ahead is crawled by smaller medusa and basilisk creatures. As far as they can see there are poles on the side of the road and ropes are knotted to them. According to the sign, everyone should close their eyes and walk along the ropes for the next mile. (A bit further down the road a merry band of bandits awaits all who are dumb enough to believe this.)","100":"A huge and deep hole in the ground and the broken remnants of a trading cart are blocking the path of the group. On a successful DC 14 Intelligence (investigation) check, the leg bones and boots of a halfling can be found and identified. The hole is part of a tunnel network inhabited by a bulette that roams the area. If the party can locate the main cave and defeat the bulette they may find some interesting items there."}},"Travelers On The Road":{"type":"Text","results":{"1":"You come across an older gentleman traveling down the path with a group of 6 small dogs walking behind him. He has them each on a small leash that is attached to his large backpack, filled with dog clothes and toys. Over the last few years, this man has trained these dogs to preform tricks. He is traveling from town to town to try and become a famous performer.","2":"You pass a person draped in flowing red and gold cloth, eyes closed and performing what looks like an incredibly slow dance. Around them are several unconscious bandits.","3":"You see an old woman with a young girl that is slowly moving towards your group. When you come closer you notice that the woman is actually blind, and the girl is guiding her. That woman gets intense when you come closer and gives away a series of phrases, each of those can be treated as a prophesy.","4":"A pair of newlyweds on their honeymoon headed to a secluded cabin in the woods. They’re both charming and friendly, but the longer you talk to them, the clearer it is that something’s amiss. Specifically, it’s very clear that the groom has quite a lot to gain in the event of the bride’s untimely demise.","5":"You kick a rock, and it appears to grow legs and claws. On close inspection, it is a fist-sized crab disguised as a stone. All rocks in the immediate area reveal themselves to be crabs as well, which begin scattering into the grass. If one is captured, it disappears during the next long rest.","6":"A dog leashed to a tree. There doesn’t seem to be anyone else around, but if the party takes the pup its owner will try to find it.","7":"A short woman peddling used magical talismans out of a cart. Her assistant, a large deaf giant who is pulling said cart, grins whenever someone comes near. Her name is Tabitha and she’s rather charming in a soft-spoken way. A bit of prodding into the pair reveals they are both friends who once adventured together.","8":"A man in tattered robes who claims to be nobility who was forced from his home by a wicked sibling. More likely he was kicked out for being a greedy twit, but the party can learn that on their own time as he makes more and more requests.","9":"Two kobolds standing on top of each other wearing an old cloak. They claim they are a famous dragonborn warrior, and they do not seem to know that they are actually two kobolds.","10":"A pair of horses, seemingly abandoned. A further inspection reveals they are still wearing riding tack and seemed to be abandoned in a hurry.","11":"A person digging a grave, with a body of some sort in a shroud nearby.","12":"A lizard folk wearing a paladin’s armor. He poorly impersonates the paladin whose armor he has and pretends to be lawful good. Or maybe he’s had a change of heart after getting the gear. Either way, he’s hungry.","13":"A shepherd with a dozen sheep. He keeps insisting that all the sheep are his and keeps looking over his shoulder.","14":"A 10-man road crew removing a stump from the middle of the road. Four of the crew are armed with bows and complain about a dryad interfering with their job. Two are doing the actual work of removing the stump. The rest are ‘supervising’.","15":"A flash flood has blocked part of the road. A sorcerer is standing nearby offering to clear a dry path for a small fee. The sorcerer is true to their word and forms a dry channel to the other side. After crossing, the channel, the flood and the sorcerer disappear.","16":"A pure black, unnaturally tall Tabaxi. She offers a magical item of the DMs choice in exchange for an interesting story. A player must offer a story that reveals a portion of their backstory and beat a DC 14 persuasion check to receive the item. Each player may attempt this once, but each time it is failed the Tabaxi’s interest wanes, increasing the DC by 2. If the Tabaxi’s DC reaches 20, she retracts, unimpressed, and leaves.","17":"A small and poor family, all their belongings in tow, moving to a new town.","18":"A Firenewt wizard who sells magic minerals, crystals and dusts. He lives in a hut with a large fire in the middle. He spends most of his days at home making powders and crafting near the fire. Although he is not the kindest, he is smart strong and helpful. He sells magical and non-magical jewelry, fireworks, components and ingredients for spells and recipes.","19":"A lonely Bullywug who got lost and lives in a cave. He considers himself the emperor of the cave. He has other frogs and toads as minions and guards.","20":"You see two figures riding on horseback: a halfling and a green dragonborn. They trot along for about a mile until they come across a heavily guarded ornate caravan on the side of the road. As it turns out, the dragonborn is a senator, on his way back from a trip to the outer villages. They stopped to feed and water the horses, and the dragonborn accidentally dropped his keys in the caravan. The halfling is the locksmith from the next town over.","21":"A stray dog, hungry and dirty, desperately needing help. It has a collar with a note attached to it which seems to be a cry for help!","22":"A Rival party of the exact same class but different archetypes. They are a little obnoxious to their counterparts and are out to do the same quest/mission/thing the party is up to.","23":"A black knight traveling on horseback. Could be revealed to be some sort of illusion, or a wandering boss-type monster.","24":"A hungry beggar, who if helped will come to their aid at a later date, if shunned will do the opposite.","25":"A crazy old man who claims to know where a secret forest full of magic is located. You follow him but he is actually just trying to take you back to his home because he has lonely ever since his wife died.","26":"Two older males each riding a giant snail. They sell common magic items, maps of nearby cave systems, and may teach the party how to enhance potions.","27":"A man with piercing blue eyes, all visible flesh but his eyes wrapped in cloth bandages. Adorned in worn and dirty cloths of a nobleman and carrying a religious text. He is polite and intense obviously religious and with a deep silky voice. Upon closer inspection, his flesh appears burned. Omens of doom and death follow in his wake.","28":"A group of guardsmen transporting the corpse of their beloved countess back to her homeland. Upon conversation, the guardsmen believe foul play was involved and ask the adventurers to investigate.","29":"Harrin, the halfling Chef and his employees, all halflings. They travel in search of the Gloomy Mushroom, said to be the most delicious thing there is. A big and gentle half-orc is their bodyguard. His nickname is Joy.","30":"A blind man stumbling along the road with a stick. If the party stop to talk to him, he will talk about how he was the best bandit in the area in his youth. Problem is he never quit when he lost his sight. His buddies are hiding in the wilderness on the side of the road and have been lining up shots on the party with their slingshots and short bows.","31":"A band of travelling bards called Heart of a Dragon on a middle of their ‘biggest tour ever’ where they are playing in multiple cities of the world. They could be a recurring encounter on different roads.","32":"A group of monks on a pilgrimage to a shrine of their order to meditate and receive training.","33":"A travelling circus with a bunch of performers, one of whom is offering to perform their tricks (tarot readings or a future event cryptic reveal) at the side of the road for a couple of coin.","34":"A zealot on a religious pilgrimage to a far-off holy site. The pilgrim has only just started and is full of spunk and cheerful evangelism. This is the pilgrim’s first pilgrimage and up until now has led a very sheltered life.","35":"The wizard Leander from Leander’s Luminous Launderette and Lavender Lavatory. They have been assaulted on their travels, both the wizard and their apprentice were injured (the apprentices wounds poisoned and almost surely infected, gangrenous, and without the help of a cleric; probably fatal.) and their wagon and gear stolen.","36":"A band of highwaymen posing as religious ascetics on a pilgrimage to a nearby temple. They plan to rob the holy site and kill everyone inside its walls.","37":"A farmer and family in tow, with three oxen, two sheep, five pigs, and seven geese following the heavily laden cart. A single rocking chair is perched precariously on top with a grandmother strapped into it.","38":"A travelling troupe of down on their luck performers with a small problem that the players can solve. In their troupe is a budding young master storyteller who is sure to be deeply interested in the players and their stories. Help or Impress them here, and tales of the team’s exploits precede them in the next big city.","39":"A dimwitted farmer who was sold a cat in a bag (and had been told it was a piglet). The farmer is despondent and has spent every penny they had in the hopes of changing their fortune.","40":"A peddler with an old horse and half broken cart who has gotten stuck in a muddy rut. The peddler is actually a spy travelling under cover and the wagon was deliberately stuck to provide an excuse to make contact. Alternatively, the goods the peddler is carrying are obviously stolen from a local power or religious group and the players may or may not know about it happening, and the peddler is willing to do a lot of things to not be caught.","41":"An incompetent adventurer that won’t take no for answer and plans to head wherever the players are going. The adventurer is friendly but seems to be trying too hard.","42":"A knight travelling with a very small, or nonexistent retinue. The knight has been forced to sell his prized warhorse for some reason, or have it knackered due to severe injury. Alternatively, the knight is actually a Paladin doing religious penance and has vowed not to ride a horse or cart for the entirety of one month and one day.","43":"A pack of dirt-covered Dwarf miners’ approach from off the road, offering to trade very valuable gems for some ale and food (‘not trail rations, real food!’). They have just struck upon a massive gem deposit and wish to celebrate. Hope you have some with you.","44":"A hunter approaches, asking for your aid. He is gaunt, obviously hungry. He says he has tracked an Owlbear to a nearby cave, and if you can help him kill it, it will feed his family for a month.","45":"You see a man’s corpse in the middle of the road. A young man, no more than eighteen or nineteen. His throat has been cut. If you stop to examine the body, you quickly see a search party coming toward you from the wood. They are looking for the man. And you should not be so close to him.","46":"You notice an elf slumped against a tree, covered in blood and on the verge of death. He reveals that he is a courier and was ambushed by bandits. He tells you that they didn’t find the message he carries; it is hidden inside his boot. He asks you to deliver the message for him to a woman named Ella Corwyn in the village of Threader’s Hollow, a few days ride out of your way. If read, it is a simple message from her son, Dennis, who is training in wizardry with the elves. If delivered, Ella will feed your group (hearty lamb stew with delicious homemade biscuits) and offer shelter in her barn, alongside her prize pig Josephine.","47":"A bear wearing a vest and derby hat is selling expertly crafted Masterwork musical instruments from an ox-drawn cart hitched to a tree by the side of the road. His name is Sir William Bearington III. He does not speak but can understand and scratch out misspelled replies on a chalkboard in Common. Should you attempt to steal from him, he will attack without hesitation, as a Dire Bear. A small collection of bards of various races have formed an impromptu jam session in a clearing nearby. They sound great, and if asked, they attribute the sound to the quality of the instruments. Anyone with a proficiency in a musical instrument and enough gold in their purse must succeed on a DC 10 Will save or feel compelled to buy one. Prices are high (2x), but the craftsmanship appears to be worth it. A flamboyantly painted sign on the side of the cart in bold calligraphy reads: “Musickyl Innstrumynts of Fynest Make, Experrtly Crafftyd by Sir Wm. Bearington III, Proprytor”","48":"A trio of dirty peasants is riding past on an impossibly fancy carriage. They nervously smile and wave at your group. A DC 18 spot check will notice a smear of blood on the side of the carriage.","49":"You come upon a group of a dozen or so young human men. They carry spears and wear leather armor. They appear to be trying to get your attention. If attacked, they immediately flee. If spoken with, they claim to be soldiers and demand a tax. If refused, they brandish their spears and talk about the wrath of the King but will flee at the first sign of violence. In reality, they are cowards and deserters, trying to make their way South.","50":"A man begs for help. He has been “robbed by bandits. Please, kind strangers, a ride into the village that’s just a day’s travel away?” At the earliest opportunity, he will attempt to steal something of value and ride away on your horse. If it seems like a good idea, he will stab you first.","51":"A very elderly couple flags you down. They ask you to leave some silver as a remembrance for their son, who was killed on this very spot twenty years ago.","52":"A Giant sits in the clearing, he is weeping. The sounds of his tears echo across the open space. His wife was recently killed by adventurers, and he will fly into a rage upon seeing your weapons. If you manage to calm him down, he introduces himself as Urgirr and will beg you to find justice for his wife by killing the Orc Barbarian “Karnak the Bold”, the Human Wizard “Aldo Blackhand”, the Dwarf Cleric “Tordok of the Mountain”, and the Gnome Rogue “Swindlow Duffington Dingle”.","53":"You come upon an impossibly elderly dwarf, naked as the day he was born, standing in the middle of the road demanding a 10 gp toll be paid. He wields a quarterstaff and proclaims himself to be the King of the Road. Thankfully, his long white beard shields his wrinkled nethers from your view.","54":"A longbowman challenges all takers to a hunting contest. A 100 gold bet. Whosoever can kill the most birds in one hour wins the purse.","55":"Morty Mennecaum, a traveling gnome alchemist has set up shop in this unlikely location. His prices are a bit above average, but he loves a joke and will negotiate if someone can make him laugh. His son, Manny, a burly fighter with a Longsword and steel shield, eyes you.","56":"A ghost hovers in your path. He is Gregor Jantos. He asks you to deliver a message to his wife Alya in a nearby town: “It was no accident. Kelvar cut me open to get to you. Don’t trust him.” When you find Alya, she has been married to Kelvar for nine years and they have a daughter together. They are quite the happy family. Gregor died twelve years ago, and he wasn’t well-liked in town. He had a reputation for getting drunk and beating on Alya.","57":"A twelve-year-old boy sits cross-legged atop a boulder that seems out of place near this stretch of road. He wears a circlet of rope around his head. If spoken to, he will open his eyes and acknowledge you and appear to pay attention, but he will not speak. He will answer yes or no questions with shakes of his head. He has taken a vow of silence and is on his way to becoming a Monk. If begged for assistance, he can show you to his monastery where you may sleep, eat, and train for up to a week.","58":"A townsman (Garg) is arguing with a traveling salesman (Phineas). He claims that he paid for 50 miracle cures, but the crate the salesman gave him only contained 46. The salesman claims that the customer must have drunk four of the doses of the cure because he “has a system”. The dispute is over 8 gold pieces.","59":"A traveling salesman blows past you on a cart. He is being chased by half a village who run after with axes and pitchforks. They claim he took advantage of them by selling them colored whiskey in a vial and saying it would cure Miner’s Fever. If you catch the salesman, he claims it’s honest work, selling people hope for an otherwise hopeless disease. He will give back 75% of the town’s money if you Intimidate him (DC 15). If you beat his Intimidate DC by 10 or more, he gives it all back.","60":"A patrol of royal guards is approaching. Six stout men, at least somewhat injured, guarding what seems to be an iron strongbox. They are traveling quickly. They say that they can tell right away that you are trustworthy folk, and they ask you to join them in transporting their incredibly valuable cargo to the King–which is several weeks travel out of your way–promising a small reward for the effort. Should you refuse, they again stress how incredibly valuable their cargo is, and explain that they are tired and weak from their journey, and vulnerable to bandits. If the strongbox is opened (by killing the guards and picking a difficult lock), it contains a letter from another kingdom–a peace treaty.","61":"A group of four small children, no more than eight or nine years old, proudly stops your group. They are adventuring heroes and want to join your party. To kill nasty trolls, and slay horrible dragons, and stay up as late as they want.","62":"A crowd of townsfolk equipped with makeshift weapons and torches is marching towards a nearby city. They proclaim that they are going to do battle with a minor local lord because his taxes are too high. If there is a fight, they will certainly be slaughtered.","63":"A small group of three older women, dressed in homespun and dirty shawls. One woman has a swollen foot and walks with a limp. One has a swollen and infected lip and drools when she speaks. A third has a twisted and infected finger, rendering her unable to grasp anything. One wields a set of shears, one a sack of prepared flax fiber, and a third a distaff and spindle. They are fey in disguise with strange power, prophetic foresight, and strange ethics. Alternatively, they are witches/hags with questionable motives, but a moral code of ‘rewarding’ those who show them respect they feel they deserve.","64":"An etymologist in absurd getup with a comedically large bug net, short shorts, pith helmet, socks and sandals. They ask for assistance catching something only they can see.","65":"You hear them before you see them. As you approach a bend in the road you hear two voices, each loudly complaining about the other. “You said you knew where we were going!” “I said that it was East, you’re the one who said a map was a waste of money!” A female Goliath sits on a fallen tree at the side of the road. A female Halfling is perched on her shoulders passing a wineskin to her companion.","66":"A seemingly normal looking man who greets the party on the road. He will mostly address the party member with the most magic jewelry. After some awkward conversation he will quickly make an attempt to steal the jewelry and run. When the party persuses him he turns into an ancient copper dragon and flies off. They won’t be able to track him. Later if the party is investigating crimes in a nearby city, they might catch word of an illegal magic black market. The copper dragon is the kingpin of the operation and will give the items back when confronted.","67":"The sky darkens and it begins to rain heavily. You see a man coming the other way, carrying a heavy umbrella and wearing a heavy coat. It rains for as long as the man is in sight, and then immediately clears.","68":"Seven dwarven miners bid you good day as they go to work in their mine.","69":"A cartographer passes who is willing to sell a copy of his map of the area for 40gp. With this map the party can travel at an additional 1d4 miles per day of travel within the area of the map.","70":"You find a wandering disciple of Gond (or any other similar god of crafting) who offers to repair any broken or damaged equipment.","71":"A wounded young knight laying down on the side of the road. His quest to save the princess from the dragon had failed, again. He went with a few adventurers and mercenaries, but he was the only survivor left.","72":"A fortune teller sits on the side of the road in a cart that she seems to operate her business out of. There’s a sign on it that explains that a simple fortune is 1 silver, but a more intricate fortune is 1 gold. (If asked to prove her talent, she performs a simple druidcraft cantrip showing tomorrow’s weather and tells them to come back tomorrow to see her if she’s correct. This may be a good place for an insight check). If any party member gets a fortune told, the DM can choose the fortune, or she can foretell imminent death in their path.","73":"A gnome is underneath a curious wagon, fiddling with a mechanical apparatus and swearing up a storm. He refuses help and insists you would just get in his way.","74":"Three high-elven sages can be seen bickering among themselves, arguing over the interpretations of a certain book on Arcana. The party is completely invisible to them if the sages are not addressed/greeted.","75":"A man with bandages over his eyes, a boot slightly larger than its mate, and a sort of mechanical prosthetic hand being led a pseudo natural hound. When questioned about the clearly unnatural dog, he just says ‘I trust him. He led me back out of there’.","76":"A chef with a small restaurant/tavern sets up on a rarely traveled roadside wondering why he never gets any customers.","77":"A tattered old man sitting by the roadside will ask for change to help feed his dog. If you spend enough time with them, the dog reveals itself to be a druid and the pair attempt to rob you.","78":"An elf and a dwarf on a cart pulled by a couple of oxen. Both wear expensive, gaudy clothes. The dwarf is puffing on a clay pipe and has an ornate repeating crossbow on his lap. They offer the party a chance to buy their wares and show them the collection of arms and armor in the cart; all used, some very obviously, with dented armor, nicked blades and blood stains. There are a few good pieces and at a good price. If there are any magical items, the vendors are unaware of this and sell them as standard. These characters make good money from looting battlefields, most of this haul from a recent clash between two nobles’ armies. At your discretion the elf may have a wand or two up his sleeve in event of trouble.","79":"A woman and six small children approach in an ox-drawn wagon. They appear dirty, tired and apprehensive, but if the party is friendly the mother will share her story: the father has run out on his family, and they could no longer afford to live in their previous home. The mother offers the party a single gold coin if they would accompany them to the next village. Rumor has it there are wolves in the area, and they are scared they won’t make it to town before nightfall.","80":"A traveling minstrel and his lover approach on a donkey. He offers to play you a tune for a coin. He is the worst singer you have ever heard. He takes your coin and carries on down the road.","81":"A large magic stone hut. The hut is immune to all magic as well as edged weapons. Inside is the home of a helpful powerful Wizard with many magic items and potions. He has made a shop which he sells him magic for slightly lower prices that the Handbook’s. He will buy any rare magic for 110% of its actual cost. He buys magic at 90% of its actual cost. Lots of people seem to come by in the day and no one seems to be there at night. This is because he talks in his sleep. On any given day, there is a 1/3 chance that he will use d4 spells in his sleep.","82":"Two famous swordsmen, having a duel.
